Week 2 lecture preparation

Lecture Notes for Week 2 will be uploaded after the lecture.

I usually upload lecture notes the day before the actual lecture. But I wouldn't be doing so today, as it will give away the answers to the challenge for the week. So I will upload the notes after the actual lecture. For tomorrow, please review the benchmarking report, bearing the posted questions in mind, and come prepared.

The guest lecture will be in class by 6.15 pm. I will just do a quick summary of last week's topics before his arrival. So please try to be on time.

Please go through the benchmarking report `Week2_CorporateForesight_BenchmarkingReport_Rene.pdf` before next week's lecture. Mr. Koo Seng Meng from AISG will be giving a guest lecture next week, starting 6.15 pm. Interesting questions raised during guest lecturers contribute to classroom participation marks.

You may focus on these questions as you review the report.

# Tips
## Week3
  - **1. Master the "Augmentation" Approach to AI**

    Do not use ChatGPT to generate your work from scratch. Instead, write the skeleton or draft based on your own experience first. Then, use AI to critique it: ask it to identify gaps, logical flaws, or areas for strengthening. This ensures the output remains *yours* while leveraging AI for enhancement. Faculty can easily spot generic AI content, but they value critical analysis augmented by tools.

    **1. 掌握AI的“增强”用法**

    不要用ChatGPT从零开始生成你的作业。相反，先根据你自己的经验写出骨架或初稿。然后，用AI来批判它：让它找出缺漏、逻辑缺陷或需要加强的地方。这样既能保证产出是*你的*，又能利用AI进行提升。老师很容易识别出通篇由AI生成的内容，但他们看重经由工具辅助的批判性分析。

  - **2. Design Incentives for "One Level Higher"**

    When creating incentive structures, avoid the trap of purely individual metrics (which create silos) or purely group metrics (which allow free riders). The best practice, as seen in the Nucor case, is to pitch incentives to "one level and one level higher." For example, incentivize a manager based on their unit's performance *plus* the performance of the larger division. This forces collaboration and the sharing of best practices without sacrificing individual accountability.

    **2. 为“高一级”设计激励机制**

    在设计激励结构时，要避免纯粹的个人指标（会导致孤岛效应）或纯粹的集体指标（会导致搭便车）。正如Nucor案例所示，最佳实践是将激励锚定在“本级和高一级”。例如，对经理的激励应基于其部门的表现*加上*整个事业部的表现。这迫使大家在不牺牲个人责任感的前提下进行协作和分享最佳实践。

  - **3. Adopt the Mindset of a "Knowledge Worker"**

    Being a knowledge worker isn't just about having a degree; it is about **reflective learning**. After completing a task or a project, always step back and ask: "Could I have done this better? Did I do anything wrong? Is there a tool that would have improved my performance?" Differentiate yourself from a skilled worker by constantly analyzing your own process, not just executing tasks.

    **3. 树立“知识型工作者”的心态**

    成为知识型工作者不只是拥有学位，更在于**反思性学习**。在完成一项任务或项目后，永远要退一步问自己：“我能做得更好吗？我做错了什么吗？有没有工具能提升我的表现？”通过不断分析自己的工作流程而不仅仅是执行任务，让自己从普通技术工人中脱颖而出。

  - **4. Match Technology Readiness with Organizational Readiness**

    In technology transfer or implementation, "one size fits all" is a recipe for failure. Use the **Readiness Matrix**: Mature (High TRL) technologies can be plugged into any firm. However, conceptual (Low TRL) technologies generally result in failure if introduced to a firm with low "Demand Readiness" (no in-house R&D capability). Ensure the maturity of the solution matches the maturity of the recipient organization.

    **4. 将技术就绪度与组织就绪度相匹配**

    在技术转移或实施中，“一刀切”是导致失败的配方。使用**就绪度矩阵**：成熟（高TRL）的技术可以植入任何公司。然而，概念性（低TRL）技术如果被引入“需求就绪度”低（没有内部研发能力）的公司，通常会导致失败。确保解决方案的成熟度与接收组织的成熟度相匹配。

  - **5. Be Practical with Organizational Change**

    Don't blindly apply textbook theories to your workplace. If you are in an SME with limited resources, do not demand a dedicated "Foresighting Department"—you might get fired for being unrealistic. Instead, start small: look for blind spots, listen to customers, and identify weak signals. Context is king; adapt your strategies to the "bandwidth" and culture of your specific organization.

    **5. 对组织变革要务实**

    别把教科书理论盲目套用到职场上。如果你身处资源有限的中小企业，不要要求设立专门的“预见部门”——你可能会因为不切实际而被炒鱿鱼。相反，从小处着手：寻找盲点，倾听客户，识别微弱信号。背景为王；要根据你所在组织的具体“带宽”和文化来调整你的策略。
## Summary Week 4 Conceptual Models & Implementing Technology Intelligence
  - **The Theoretical Framework (Design, Direct, Develop)**

    The core of this week’s lecture focused on the theoretical underpinnings of setting up a Technology Intelligence (TI) system. We moved beyond *what* TI is to *how* to implement it from scratch. The process is governed by **TI Management**, which consists of three critical phases: **Designing** (creating a theoretical model suitable for the specific industry and organizational culture), **Directing** (orienting the system, allocating resources, and assigning analysts to fulfill the mission), and **Developing** (continuously monitoring and upgrading the system to ensure it doesn't fail). This management layer sits above the operational cycle of searching, filtering, and analyzing information.

    **理论框架（设计、指导、发展）**

    本周讲座的核心重点是建立技术情报（TI）系统的理论基础。我们从 TI *是*什么，转向了*如何*从头开始实施它。这个过程由 **TI 管理** 主导，包含三个关键阶段：**设计**（创建适合特定行业和组织文化的理论模型）、**指导**（以履行使命为导向调整系统、分配资源和指派分析师）以及 **发展**（持续监控和升级系统以确保其不会失败）。这一管理层位于搜索、过滤和分析信息的运作循环之上。

  - **The Great Debate: Intelligence \*of\* the Organization vs. Organizational Intelligence**

    We debated two distinct approaches to TI. **"Intelligence of the Organization"** refers to a top-down approach where decision-makers formulate specific questions ("When will this technology mature?") and direct analysts to find answers. This is efficient and focused but risks confirmation bias and myopia. Conversely, **"Organizational Intelligence"** is a bottom-up approach where every employee acts as a scout (the "passive" mode), gathering information and pushing it upward. While this fosters innovation (e.g., the Adobe/Xerox example) and diverse perspectives, it can lead to chaos and information overload ("noise") if not properly filtered through knowledge management systems.

    **大辩论：组织的智能 vs. 组织性智能**

    我们辩论了两种截然不同的 TI 方法。**“组织的智能（Intelligence of the Organization）”** 指的是自上而下的方法，决策者制定具体问题（“这项技术何时成熟？”）并指导分析师寻找答案。这很高效且聚焦，但有确认偏见和短视的风险。相反，**“组织性智能（Organizational Intelligence）”** 是一种自下而上的方法，每个员工都充当侦察员（“被动”模式），收集信息并向上推送。虽然这促进了创新（例如 Adobe/Xerox 的例子）和多样化的视角，但如果没有通过知识管理系统进行适当过滤，可能会导致混乱和信息过载（“噪音”）。

  - **Data Sources & The "Color" of Intelligence**

    The lecture categorized intelligence sources into three "colors": **White** (publicly available info like patents and publications), **Grey** (informal info from experts, conferences, and trade shows), and **Black** (illegal or unethical methods like dumpster diving, fake interviews, or supplier leaks). While Black intelligence exists in reality, the focus should be on ethical gathering. A crucial insight was that suppliers and "transit hubs" (like airports where experts gather) are often rich sources of Grey intelligence.

    **数据来源与情报的“颜色”**

    讲座将情报来源分为三种“颜色”：**白色**（公开信息，如专利和出版物）、**灰色**（来自专家、会议和贸易展的非正式信息）和 **黑色**（非法或不道德的手段，如翻垃圾桶、虚假面试或供应商泄密）。虽然黑色情报在现实中存在，但重点应放在合乎道德的收集上。一个重要的见解是，供应商和“中转枢纽”（如专家聚集的机场）通常是灰色情报的丰富来源。

  - **Organizational Structures (Lichtenthaler's Model)**

    We examined three structural modes for TI units:

    1. **Structured (Centralized):** A dedicated HQ unit with decentralized listening posts. Common in large, hierarchical organizations (e.g., Government agencies).
    2. **Informal (Decentralized):** Everyone participates; relies on culture, "slack resources" (free time for exploration), and job rotation. Common in SMEs or innovative tech firms (e.g., Google).
    3. **Hybrid:** A mix, such as forming ad-hoc "communities of practice" for specific technologies (e.g., combinatorial chemistry) that may later be integrated into the central unit.

    **组织结构（Lichtenthaler 模型）**

    我们审查了 TI 单元的三种结构模式：

    1. **结构化（集中式）：** 拥有专门的总部单元和分散的监听站。常见于大型等级制组织（如政府机构）。
    2. **非正式（分散式）：** 每个人都参与；依赖于文化、“松弛资源”（用于探索的空闲时间）和工作轮换。常见于中小企业或创新科技公司（如 Google）。
    3. **混合式：** 两者的混合，例如为特定技术（如组合化学）组建临时的“实践社区”，随后可能被整合进中央单元。

  - **The "Tool": Formulating the Right Questions**

    We introduced the **Kerr Information Needs Template**. The most critical step in TI is framing the right question using the 5W1H method (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How). The template helps stakeholders collaboratively define **Application Areas** (where can it be used?), **Technological Aspects** (feasibility, skills), and **Market/Commercial Aspects** (cost, ROI). A key addition to this canvas is considering **Ethics and Policy**, which are often overlooked but vital.

    **“工具”：制定正确的问题**

    我们介绍了 **Kerr 信息需求模板**。TI 中最关键的一步是使用 5W1H 方法（谁、什么、哪里、何时、为什么、如何）构建正确的问题。该模板帮助利益相关者协作定义 **应用领域**（可以用在哪里？）、**技术方面**（可行性、技能）和 **市场/商业方面**（成本、投资回报率）。这个画布的一个关键补充是考虑 **伦理和政策**，这两点经常被忽视但至关重要。
## Learning Tips & "Secret Recipes" for Assessment Week 4
  1. **Logbook Strategy: Aim for Level 4**

     - **Don't just summarize.** "Level 1" work is just repeating the lecture.
     - **To get an "A":** You must demonstrate **Higher-Order Thinking**.
       - *Context:* Relate the theory to your specific work experience.
       - *Critique:* Identify challenges or gaps in the theory based on reality.
       - *Solution:* Propose "out-of-the-box" mitigation strategies or improvements that go beyond the textbook.
     - **The "Secret Ingredient":** The professor explicitly stated that discussing **Ethical Implications** (which are often missing from standard frameworks) will "win his heart." Use this wisely in your logbook analysis.

     **Logbook 策略：以此为目标冲刺 Level 4**

     - **不要只是总结。** “Level 1” 的作业只是复述讲座。
     - **要拿“A”：** 你必须展示 **高阶思维**。
       - *背景：* 将理论与你的具体工作经验联系起来。
       - *批判：* 基于现实识别理论中的挑战或差距。
       - *解决方案：* 提出超越教科书的“跳出框框”的缓解策略或改进方案。
     - **“秘方”：** 教授明确表示，讨论 **伦理影响**（这通常在标准框架中缺失）会“赢得他的心”。在你的 Logbook 分析中明智地使用这一点。

  2. **The "Boring Paper" Assignment (Compulsory)**

     - **Task:** Read the paper by **Lichtenthaler** (provided in the reading list).
     - **Requirement:** You must create a **Visual Synthesis** (Mind Map, Block Diagram, or Pictorial representation) of the paper's key messages.
     - **Constraint:** Do not write a long essay about it. The goal is to act like an analyst: extract value from dense information and present it concisely. This is a *compulsory* entry for your final logbook submission.

     **“无聊论文”作业（必修）**

     - **任务：** 阅读 **Lichtenthaler** 的论文（在阅读清单中提供）。
     - **要求：** 你必须创建论文关键信息的 **视觉综合**（思维导图、框图或图形表示）。
     - **约束：** 不要写长篇大论。目标是像分析师一样行事：从密集的信息中提取价值并简洁地呈现。这是你最终 Logbook 提交中的一个 *必修* 条目。

  3. **Discussion Forum Etiquette**

     - **Avoid "Me Too" Comments:** Do not just agree with previous posts.
     - **Build & Twist:** Take an existing point (e.g., short-term vs. long-term) and add a specific, novel angle (e.g., "How does short-term thinking affect the retention of HR talent in a toxic culture?").
     - **Debate:** It is encouraged to respectfully counter-argue. If someone says "Top-down is best," argue for "Bottom-up" using specific examples of innovation or missed opportunities.

     **讨论论坛礼仪**

     - **避免“我也一样”的评论：** 不要只是同意之前的帖子。
     - **构建与转折：** 拿出一个现有的观点（例如，短期与长期），并增加一个具体的、新颖的角度（例如，“短期思维如何影响在有毒文化中保留 HR 人才？”）。
     - **辩论：** 鼓励尊重的反驳。如果有人说“自上而下最好”，请用创新的具体例子或错失的机会来为“自下而上”辩护。

  4. **Upcoming Schedule (Zoom)**

     - **Next Week:** Guest lecture by **Renee** (via Zoom) followed by the professor's lecture (also via Zoom). There will be no physical class.
     - **Action:** Look out for the Zoom link details by next Wednesday.

     **接下来的安排（Zoom）**

     - **下周：** **Renee** 的客座讲座（通过 Zoom），随后是教授的讲座（也通过 Zoom）。没有线下课。
     - **行动：** 留意下周三之前发出的 Zoom 链接详情。

# Lectures
## Week 1
  - **00:00 – 02:46: Introduction to Foresighting Tools and Reading Load**

    ...tons and tons of things. Read doesn't mean you have to understand everything and imbibe everything. You need to give a cursory look and get the bigger picture, and see what is the important aspect of it. If it's relevant, you note it down. And it's only later on you're going to dive deep into techniques. Okay? If you look at—many of you mentioned about forecasting—if you look at forecasting tools, there are dozens of tools, techniques, and analysis available. If you expect a module to teach you everything, no one can do justice. So, what I'm here to do is to expose you to different techniques, okay, and what are the advantages and disadvantages. If you think at some point, for example, I will talk about qualitative techniques, I'll talk about quantitative techniques. In qualitative techniques, there are a few which I will give you an idea of how it is done. The reason is when you are expected to do that particular one, you have to dive deep to do that particular one. Because not all techniques are suited for all kinds of scenarios. So, I'll give you the breadth of the knowledge, and then you have to pick it up along the way. That's what this module is. So, you'll have to read, as a foresighting officer, as an intelligence officer, you need to read tons and tons of boring, drowsy—trust me, I'll ensure that I'll give at least a couple of articles which will put you to sleep. Because when I read the module, I had to read it three, four times because every time I started off, it put me to sleep. But that is the dirty job of an intelligence officer. Okay? You need to look for what is called as "gray information." You need to look for white spaces. And to get those white spaces, you need to dig into articles and identify the gem from there. That's valuable for your organization because if you look for very obvious clues that are out there—like he said, right, "I read news articles to know what is happening in the industry." By the time it comes as news articles, what happens? If you are a company, they're going to pick signals from there. You're already too late. You're not going to win the race.

    ……成千上万的东西。阅读并不意味着你必须理解所有内容并全盘吸收。你需要粗略地浏览，了解大局，看看其中重要的方面是什么。如果相关，你就记下来。只有在后来你才会深入研究具体技术。好吗？如果你看——你们很多人提到了预测——如果你看预测工具，有几十种工具、技术和分析方法可用。如果你期望一个模块能教会你一切，那是无法做到的。所以，我在这里要做的是让你们接触不同的技术，好吗，以及它们的优缺点是什么。比如，我会谈论定性技术，我会谈论定量技术。在定性技术中，我会向你们介绍其中几种是如何操作的。原因是当你被期望使用某种特定技术时，你必须深入研究才能掌握它。因为并不是所有的技术都适合所有类型的场景。所以，我会给你们知识的广度，然后你们必须在过程中自己掌握它。这就是这门模块的内容。所以，作为一名预见官员，作为一名情报官员，你需要阅读成千上万无聊、令人昏昏欲睡的东西——相信我，我会确保给你们几篇会让你们睡着的文章。因为当我备课时，我不得不读了三四遍，因为每次我开始读的时候，它都让我睡着了。但这正是情报官员的苦差事。好吗？你需要寻找所谓的“灰色信息”。你需要寻找空白领域。为了找到那些空白领域，你需要深入挖掘文章并从中识别出精华。这对你的组织很有价值，因为如果你只寻找外面非常明显的线索——就像他说的，“我阅读新闻文章来了解行业发生了什么。”等到它成为新闻文章时，会发生什么？如果你是一家公司，竞争对手也会从那里获取信号。你已经太晚了。你赢不了这场比赛。

  - **02:46 – 05:32: The Three Types of Intelligence Information (White, Gray, Black)**

    So, the smartness lies in, before it becomes a news article, you become the news article. For that, you need to do the dirty job of digging into dirty paperworks, and sometimes, in intelligence, there is something called—there are three kinds of information. One is white, the other one is gray, the third one is black. White information are published informations like news articles, patents, publications, everything, right? And even products sometimes. Gray information are information that you collect from talking to experts. You're hand-collecting data, right? You talk to them, you ask them, "Hey, what do you think the industry will be five years down the line?" And many of the articles on foresighting that is written is as an outcome of talking to experts like that. Since you collect the data talking to experts, they are called gray information. And there is something called black. Which is... What is black information? What is black money? Something like that. What is black information?

    Student: Dirty money?

    Professor: Dirty money. Likewise, dirty information. How do you get it?

    Student: Illegal.

    Professor: Like what? Like how?

    Student: Insider trading.

    Professor: Insider trading... which is one possible ways. Some industries, especially in the pharmaceutical industry—I don't know if I've shared with MT5004 folks—what they do is, one chemical company, pharmaceutical company, they will look into the trash cans of their competitor company because there could be wealth in the trash can which they shred and put. They go dig in and find some information out of it. Sometimes they hijack people from one company to another, which is very frequently happening in tech companies. All these come under black information. If you want to be in the forefront of innovation—don't go and tell this professor is propagating something illegal, okay? But I'm just saying what is happening in the industry, right? So, if you want to be in the forefront of innovation, people look for all kinds of information, and you can't wait for neatly published thing and then go and look into it to make your company decision. That's not going to work. So, in the process of teaching you how nasty it is, I will also make you read some nasty articles. If you're not ready for it, good for me. Drop the module. Right?

    所以，聪明之处在于，在它成为新闻文章之前，你先成为新闻。为此，你需要做深入挖掘繁琐文件的苦差事，有时，在情报中，有三种信息。一种是白色，另一种是灰色，第三种是黑色。白色信息是公开的信息，如新闻文章、专利、出版物，所有这些，对吧？有时甚至包括产品。灰色信息是你通过与专家交谈收集的信息。你在手动收集数据，对吧？你和他们交谈，问他们，“嘿，你认为五年后的行业会是什么样？”许多关于预见性的文章都是与此类专家交谈的结果。因为数据是你通过与专家交谈收集的，所以它们被称为灰色信息。还有一种叫做黑色信息。那是……什么是黑色信息？什么是黑钱？类似那样的。什么是黑色信息？

    学生：脏钱？

    教授：脏钱。同样地，脏信息。你怎么得到它？

    学生：非法手段。

    教授：比如什么？怎么做？

    学生：内幕交易。

    教授：内幕交易……这是一种可能的方式。一些行业，特别是在制药行业——我不知道我是否与MT5004的同学分享过——他们做的是，一家化学公司或制药公司，会去翻竞争对手公司的垃圾桶，因为垃圾桶里可能有被粉碎掉的财富。他们去挖掘并从中找到一些信息。有时他们从一家公司挖角人才到另一家公司，这在科技公司经常发生。所有这些都属于黑色信息。如果你想处于创新的前沿——不要去说这个教授在宣传非法的东西，好吗？但我只是说行业中正在发生什么，对吧？所以，如果你想处于创新的前沿，人们会寻找各种信息，你不能等待整齐发表的东西，然后再去研究它来做公司决策。那是行不通的。所以，在教你们这行有多残酷的过程中，我也会让你们读一些枯燥的文章。如果你还没准备好，那对我很好。退课吧。对吧？

  - **05:32 – 08:20: Presentation Skills and Class Expectations**

    Then the second thing. When it comes to this module, I, as decision makers, you know that they are time-pressed. They are not going to read your 10 pages or 20 pages report. Whatever intelligence you gather, you should be able to summarize it in a neat pictorial form to them. One example is we already have in this... here. Big Data Analytics. This is a report created for decision makers which involved months and months of efforts. And every block out there will tell the decision makers who are the companies there, whom I know, whom I do not know, what kind of technologies are there, what kind of agencies are there that I need to tap into for my funding, and everything. So, every outcome as an intelligence officer, you need to present it in a very concise, pictorial form like this to your bosses. So that when they give a cursory look, they kind of get the bigger picture, and they want to dive deep into certain things, they will ask you and you will give tons of documents related to it later on. But your first presentation has to be like this. So, many of the presentations which you do for this module will not be in the form of write-up, blah, blah, blah. It will be in the form of giving in form of mind map, pictures, road map, whatever you can think of in pictorial form because that's going to train you to be an analyst at some point, right? Because you can't give... You need to have reports written down, but that you can anyway do. You have ChatGPT, blah, blah, blah, right? But what you need to do is present all the information. There are some homeworks wherein I'll give you to read an article which is very boring and take the gist of it and present it in this form as well. That will assess you on whether you're able to pick gems out of rubbish and then present it in a form that is palatable to the decision makers who are time-pressed. Make sense to you? If you think you're not up to it, again, drop the module. Okay? So, this is what you can expect from the module. You may have to read. You may have to present, be able to present. And I will have forum discussion. I don't take attendance for this module, unlike 5007. And I'll make the webcast available as well. If you're here, I want you to be here. You get what I mean? Participate in class discussion. Don't be busy with your Snapchat, blah, blah, blah. If you're here, be here. And engage in a lot of group activities because you need to inevitably work with groups. And today also, I want you to work as a group on a topic. You know, you will be forced to think and work like consultants in this module. There will be a lot of group activity.



    然后是第二件事。说到这个模块，作为决策者，你们知道他们时间紧迫。他们不会读你的10页或20页报告。无论你收集什么情报，你都应该能够以整洁的图示形式向他们总结。这里就有一个例子：大数据分析（Big Data Analytics）。这是一份为决策者创建的报告，涉及数月的努力。那里的每一个区块都会告诉决策者那是谁的公司，我认识谁，我不认识谁，有什么样的技术，有什么样的机构是我需要利用来获取资金的，以及一切。所以，作为一名情报官员的每一个成果，你都需要像这样以非常简洁、图示的形式呈现给你的老板。这样当他们粗略一看，就能了解大局，而当他们想深入研究某些事情时，他们会问你，然后你再给他们成吨的相关文件。但你的第一次演示必须是这样的。所以，你们为这个模块做的许多演示不会是以书面形式，巴拉巴拉巴拉。它将是以思维导图、图片、路线图的形式，无论你能想到的什么图示形式，因为那将训练你成为一名分析师，对吧？因为你不能给……你需要有写下来的报告，但无论如何你都能做到。你有ChatGPT，巴拉巴拉，对吧？但你需要做的是呈现所有信息。会有一些作业，我会让你们读一篇非常无聊的文章，提取它的要点，并以这种形式呈现。那将评估你是否能够从垃圾中挑选宝石，然后以一种时间紧迫的决策者可以接受的形式呈现出来。这有道理吗？如果你认为你做不到，再次强调，退课。好吗？所以，这就是你可以从这个模块期待的。你可能需要阅读。你可能需要演示，能够演示。我会进行论坛讨论。我不像5007那样这门课点名。我也会提供网络直播。如果你人在这里，我希望你的心也在这里。你明白我的意思吗？参与课堂讨论。不要忙于你的Snapchat，巴拉巴拉。如果你在这里，就在这里。并参与很多小组活动，因为你不可避免地需要与小组合作。今天也是，我希望你们作为一个小组在一个话题上工作。你知道，在这个模块中，你将被迫像顾问一样思考和工作。会有很多小组活动。

  - **08:20 – 10:00: Carlson's Article and Logbook Requirements**

    And to make it, I dropped an email saying that there is an interesting activity. We will, at the end of this class, know about what is intelligence and foresighting and how do you go about doing it using Carlson's article. How many of you managed to go through Carlson's article? Please raise your hand. Okay. Sizable number, though not all. Okay, if you're expected to read an article, please read it because we'll have lots of discussion. I won't be spoon-feeding the module... or the papers in class, okay? It's good to rush through. And I told you that there will be an interesting challenge—that's why I asked you to go through. And in this class, there is going to be class participation grade, 30% , and there is going to be what is called as Logbook. Uh, for those who have done 5007, you know what a logbook is. For those who are not, what is a logbook? Logbook basically, if you take this particular week, you will take the topic of what is intelligence and foresighting and all. That's the core message from this week, right? So you can maintain a logbook of whatever we covered in class. There are three levels to logbook. The first level is what is intelligence, what is foresighting, whatever we discussed in class, you can write it. That is Level 1 logbook. And Level 2 logbook is whatever we covered in class, if you can relate it to your examples or workplace or experiences, whatever you encountered in life, "Okay, I did this kind of foresighting and this is what we did." And if you explain about your experience-related aspects, that's Level 2. And Level 3 is...



    为了做到这一点，我发了一封邮件说有一个有趣的活动。在这节课结束时，我们将了解什么是情报和预见，以及如何使用Carlson的文章去做。你们中有多少人阅读了Carlson的文章？请举手。好的。人数相当可观，虽然不是全部。好的，如果要求你们阅读一篇文章，请阅读它，因为我们会有很多讨论。我不会在课堂上填鸭式地教模块内容……或论文，好吗？快速浏览是好的。我告诉过你们会有一个有趣的挑战——这就是为什么我让你们去阅读。在这节课中，将会有课堂参与成绩，占30% ，还有一个叫做日志（Logbook）的东西 。呃，对于那些修过5007的人，你们知道什么是日志。对于那些没修过的，什么是日志？日志基本上，如果你拿这周来说，你会记录什么是情报和预见等主题。那是这周的核心信息，对吧？所以你可以维护一个关于我们在课堂上涵盖的内容的日志。日志有三个级别。第一级是什么是情报，什么是预见，无论我们在课堂上讨论什么，你可以写下来。那是1级日志。2级日志是无论我们在课堂上涵盖什么，如果你能将其与你的例子、工作场所或生活经历联系起来，“好的，我做了这种预见，这就是我们所做的。”如果你解释关于你经验相关的方面，那是2级。3级是……

  - **10:00 – 12:45: Levels of Logbook and Forum Participation**

    ...If you did engage in intelligence activity or foresighting activity, you encountered certain problems, certain issues, and you learned certain things from it which is informative to others. That is... it's like questioning certain aspects, right? That will be Level 3 of logbook. So in this module, one of the deliverables at the end of the module is logbook, for which you need to maintain logbook for five weeks. Topics on five topics. It could be Week 1 to Week 5, you can finish it by mid-term break, everything. Or if not, we'll be covering a lot of tools in the second part of the module, you can do that as well because they are more hands-on tools. Okay? So you need to maintain the logbook for five weeks. And class participation, of course, is there, right? You can participate in class by throwing in your ideas, or you can also take it to Canvas forum, like MT5007. Last year when I maintained the forum, I got the feedback saying there are some people who use ChatGPT to put it there for the sake of number. They were people, I knew it. And there are people who use their own experience to contribute to forum, right? So what I've decided for this module is I'll have two categories of forum discussion: one which allows people to use ChatGPT and throw in the ideas because I know there are students without work experience. I don't want them to be put in any disadvantages position. So if they're using ChatGPT, use ChatGPT, but learn something out of it and post in the forum. Don't just copy-paste there, okay? And they are going to be very long and try to be short, not more than 100 words. Try to be as short as possible for ChatGPT folks. I'm going to open a separate thread for those who are not using ChatGPT so that it's fully based on their experience. Okay? So that the group is split. Of course you can learn from each other, but I don't want people who are using experience alone to be bombarded with ChatGPT messages. That's the intention of separating them. So the class participation is from class, which Changhong will be noting down, I'll be noting down on the quality, and in terms of forum also I'll be moderating it. I won't answer but I'll take interesting threads from there and discuss in class like last semester as well. That's what we'll do. So that is class participation. I'll talk about it later. But, yes, Li Tian?

    Student: Uh, for the discussion forum, will we receive different marks for the different...

    Professor: Of course, right? Someone based on experience will have a richer value than those based only on ChatGPT, right? Of course there'll be difference. Now, um, because there are many people who just copy-pasted it. And my only hope is that in the process of doing that, they would search something related to the topic. Something will spill over. That's my intention. So I don't want to stop them, right? But I don't want that group to bombard the other group. That's why I'm separating it. And it's totally based on the feedback that I received from last semester. I just came up with a method to separate it.

    ……如果你确实参与了情报活动或预见活动，你遇到了一些问题，一些挑战，并且你从中学习到了对他人有信息价值的东西。那是……这就像质疑某些方面，对吧？那将是3级日志。所以在这个模块中，模块结束时的交付成果之一是日志，你需要维护五周的日志。关于五个主题。可以是从第1周到第5周，你可以在期中休息前完成所有的。或者如果没有，我们将在模块的第二部分涵盖很多工具，你也可以做那个，因为它们更多是动手操作的工具。好吗？所以你需要维护五周的日志。当然还有课堂参与，对吧？你可以通过抛出你的想法来参与课堂，或者你也可以把它带到Canvas论坛，就像MT5007一样。去年当我维护论坛时，我收到了反馈说有些人使用 ChatGPT 为了凑数而发布内容。确实有人这样做，我知道。还有一些人利用他们自己的经验为论坛做贡献，对吧？所以我为这个模块决定的是，我将设两类论坛讨论：一类允许人们使用ChatGPT并抛出想法，因为我知道有些学生没有工作经验。我不希望他们处于任何劣势地位。所以如果他们使用ChatGPT，那就使用ChatGPT，但要从中学习一些东西并在论坛上发布。不要只是复制粘贴到那里，好吗？而且那会很长，尽量简短，不要超过100个字。对于ChatGPT用户，尽量简短。我将为那些不使用ChatGPT的人开设一个单独的帖子，这样它就完全基于他们的经验。好吗？这样小组就分开了。当然你们可以互相学习，我不希望那些仅依靠经验的人被ChatGPT的消息轰炸。这就是分开他们的意图。所以课堂参与是来自课堂的，Changhong会记录下来，我会记录质量，在论坛方面我也会主持。我不会回答，但我会从中挑选有趣的帖子并在课堂上讨论，就像上学期一样。这就是我们要做的。所以那就是课堂参与。我稍后再谈。但是，是的，Li Tian？

    学生：呃，关于讨论论坛，不同的……我们会得到不同的分数吗？

    教授：当然，对吧？基于经验的人会比那些仅基于ChatGPT的人有更丰富的价值，对吧？当然会有区别。现在，嗯，因为有很多人只是复制粘贴。我唯一的希望是，在这样做的过程中，他们会搜索一些与主题相关的东西。会有一些东西溢出。那是我的意图。所以我不想阻止他们，对吧？但我不想那一组轰炸另一组。这就是我把它们分开的原因。这完全是基于我上学期收到的反馈。我只是想出了一个方法来分开它。

  - **12:45 – 15:30: Challenge for the Day: Forecasting vs. Foresighting vs. Intelligence**

    Now, any questions on this? But what I'm going to do is, every class I'm going to ask... post a challenge for the day. This is the challenge for the day. And if the challenge has been answered by someone to my satisfaction, the person is free to go home. I would assume your logbook for that week is maintained. And you'll have full marks for the class participation for that week. Is that clear? But you need to answer it to my satisfaction. All right? Is that clear? So if you can... if you're up to the challenge...

    [Audio clip playing: Someone plan the business...]

    And if you answer it well, you have a free day with full marks. And you can in your logbook, you can say, "Week 1, I was exempted, I got full marks." You just put it there, I give you full marks. Up to it? Yeah? If you want to still be in the class, of course you're most welcome, but if you're done, you can leave. Okay. Today's challenge is this: What is foresighting and how is it different from forecasting and intelligence? That's the first question. If you... one of you said the title is interested me, right? Someone here. You said, it's forecasting, intelligence, foresighting. Name it, you see it. What is the difference? Anybody. Is the question clear? What is the difference between the three?

    It would help if you have a name board like that so that I can call out your name. So next class please have it like that, okay? Or if you have a piece of paper, just write down your name. So that I'm more familiar and it's easier for Changhong to note down as well.

    Student: I haven't really thought through, but... yeah...

    Professor: Just pass it round.

    Student: But here goes nothing.

    Professor: They will have a pen.

    Student: Okay, okay.

    Student: So I... I know that answer is not wholly correct but I just still want to give it a shot. So maybe like foresighting relates to more like... relies on... uh... relies more on your experiences and your expertise, but like forecasting and intelligence relates to more using data and your tactical... I mean like theoretical models to make the decision.

    Professor: Not exactly. You need to use experience for all three. That's why it's not correct. You use data even for forecasting. You use data for intelligence and you will of course use data for foresighting as well. Everything is data first. Yes? Uh... please tell your name so that Changhong can note down and then...

    现在，对此有什么问题吗？但我打算做的是，每节课我都要问……发布当天的挑战。这是今天的挑战。如果有人回答了这个挑战并且让我满意，这个人就可以自由回家了。我会假设你那周的日志已经维护好了。并且你将获得那周课堂参与的满分。清楚了吗？但你需要回答到让我满意。好吗？清楚了吗？所以如果你能……如果你准备好接受挑战……

    [播放音频片段：有人计划生意……]

    如果你回答得好，你就可以有一天自由时间并获得满分。你可以在你的日志里说，“第1周，我被豁免了，我得了满分。”你只需写在那里，我就给你满分。准备好了吗？是吗？如果你还想待在课堂上，当然非常欢迎，但如果你完成了，你可以离开。好的。今天的挑战是：什么是预见（Foresighting），它与预测（Forecasting）和情报（Intelligence）有什么不同？这是第一个问题。如果你们……你们中有人说标题引起了我的兴趣，对吧？这里的某人。你说，是预测、情报、预见。说出名字，你就看见了。有什么区别？任何人。问题清楚吗？这三者之间有什么区别？

    如果你有像那样的名牌会很有帮助，这样我就能叫出你的名字。所以下节课请那样做，好吗？或者如果你有一张纸，就写下你的名字。这样我就更熟悉了，Changhong也更容易记录下来。

    学生：我还没有真正想清楚，但是……是的……

    教授：把它传过去。

    学生：但这可能毫无结果。

    教授：他们会有笔的。

    学生：好的，好的。

    学生：所以我……我知道那个答案并不完全正确，但我还是想试一试。所以也许像预见更多地与……依赖于……呃……更多地依赖于你的经验和你的专业知识，但像预测和情报更多地与使用数据和你的战术……我是说像理论模型来做决定有关。

    教授：不完全是。你需要为这三者都使用经验。这就是为什么它不正确。你甚至为预测使用数据。你为情报使用数据，当然你也也会为预见使用数据。一切都是数据优先。是的？呃……请告诉你的名字，以便Changhong可以记录下来，然后……

  - **15:30 – 17:50: Student Attempts at Defining Forecasting vs. Foresighting**

    Student: My name is Long. So for foresight is what would likely happen, predict the future in my opinion. Forecast is more structured, how we anticipate and deal with... what's coming. Intelligence is based on what current information we have in order to... to deal and to be able to implement based on what information we have right now.

    Professor: Almost there. But not exactly there. Almost there. So you can go for half of the class. Yes?

    Student: Um... foresighting is based... you also look at the future and you also look at the current state, so it's also backward looking. While forecasting and intelligence is more just outward looking rather than inward looking as well.

    Professor: The forecasting is more looking backwards. Yes. It's opposite. Anyone else? Yeah?

    Student: Maybe intelligence is based on existing data. I mean current decision. Just forecasting is about predicting the future based on existing data also. Then foresighting is different... different outcomes so that experience and decision.

    Professor: Yeah. It's a refined form of his answer. Good. Yeah. Almost there. Yeah? I can say he's answered about 90%, you answered 80%. Yeah? Anyone else who wants to give it a shot building on what these people said?

    Okay. If you want to leave you can leave, the two of you. Okay.

    There is something called hindsight, insight, and foresight. Hindsight is based on past. Whatever you have done, whatever data you have got. So based on whatever you have got so far, you're going to see, extrapolate, what could be a potential future. Right? It's like if you have data points till here, you're predicting for one or two more data points. That's forecast.

    学生：我叫Long。所以在我看来，预见（Foresight）是可能会发生什么，预测未来。预测（Forecast）更有结构，我们如何预期和处理……即将到来的事情。情报（Intelligence）是基于我们目前拥有的信息，以便……根据我们现在拥有的信息来处理和实施。

    教授：差不多了。但不完全是。差不多了。所以你可以离开一半的课。是的？

    学生：嗯……预见是基于……你也看未来，你也看当前状态，所以它也是向后看的。而预测和情报更多是向外看，而不是向内看。

    教授：预测更多是向后看。是的。是相反的。还有其他人吗？是的？

    学生：也许情报是基于现有数据。我是说当前的决定。只是预测也是基于现有数据预测未来。然后预见是不同的……不同的结果，以便经验和决策。

    教授：是的。那是他答案的改进形式。很好。是的。差不多了。是的？我可以说他回答了大约90%，你回答了80%。是的？还有其他人想在他俩说的基础上试一试吗？

    好的。如果你们想离开，你们可以离开，你们两个。好的。

    有所谓的后见之明（Hindsight）、洞察力（Insight）和预见（Foresight）。后见之明是基于过去的。无论你做了什么，无论你得到了什么数据。所以基于你目前得到的一切，你要看，外推，什么可能是潜在的未来。对吧？就像如果你有到这里的数据点，你在预测另外一两个数据点。那是预测（Forecast）。

  - **17:50 – 19:15: Defining Intelligence and Foresighting**

    When it comes to intelligence, like what he said and what he said, insight is all about currently I am looking at the trend. What is going on? Suddenly COVID hit. Right? It's an information that has come to you. And I act on that and I make my decisions. Okay, COVID has hit. My... I am in the service sector, I'm going to be hit. I'm going to revamp into something else. So that is intelligence. Based on the current data which I am getting, I am doing some analysis, gathering some intelligence, and then making decisions based on it. But when it comes to foresighting, it's very futuristic. Five years down the line...

    当谈到情报（Intelligence）时，就像他说的和他说的，洞察力（Insight）完全是关于我现在正在看趋势。正在发生什么？突然COVID来袭。对吧？这是一个传给你的信息。我据此采取行动并做出决定。好的，COVID来袭了。我的……我在服务行业，我将受到打击。我要改造成别的东西。所以那就是情报。基于我目前得到的当前数据，我正在做一些分析，收集一些情报，然后据此做出决定。但是当谈到预见（Foresighting）时，它是非常未来主义的。五年后……

  - **19:15 – 22:30: Hindsight, Insight, and Foresighting Explained**

    ...Five years down the line, ten years down the line. Bear in mind, for many of you who shared your ideas on why you are in this class, five years down the line, ten years down the line, when it comes to foresighting, you are not here to predict exactly "this is what is going to happen." If you were to do it, you're doing wrong foresight. Okay? Five years down the line, ten years down the line, future could be like this, or like this, or like this, or like this. You come up with or you paint different scenarios of the future. Right? And what you do today is, if one of those futures were to come into reality, how am I going to prepare myself to navigate through, rather than being thrown out of it. You get what I mean? So let's break it down to your personal life. Okay. Tomorrow if I ask you, what is your day going to be like, Karishma?

    Student: I'll do another module at the same time.

    Professor: You'll wake up and you whatever your day job is, you'll do and then you'll be here for the class. But if I ask you like a few months down the line, will you be able to say?

    Student: Not so accurately.

    Professor: Yeah. Especially if I ask you about your summer. In June, on June 15th, what are you going to do?

    Student: Oh, my mom has plans to go to India, while my father has plans to go to Europe.

    Professor: Whatever, right? If that were to happen, how do I prepare myself today? If this were to happen, what do I do? If I'm going to look for jobs, what do I do? So future... or foresighting is all about what could be potential future, what could be one of the potential states—or there could be multiple states—and how I prepare myself to be there if one of the states were to happen. Right? And when you do that, even that is data-based. Because if you were to paint this scenario could happen, that scenario could happen, you need to collect a lot of data as well. What kind of data you will collect? You'll collect data about... if you're looking for a job. What kind of data you will collect to paint your future scenarios?

    You might even look at which countries are doing well. You might even closely watch Trump, what he's doing, so that you can avoid him neatly and look for elsewhere, right? And you might look at how technology... what is AI happening, is it becoming a fad or is it there to disrupt you? There is... this is one question which is haunting many people. Is AI there to remain or leave? Right? Many questions are hovering around that. When it comes to energy system, he said solar. Is it solar the way that we need to go or is it something else? Is it already maturing or is it saturated? That's one question that we will be looking at. There are other promising energy... you know, alternative energy that you can bet on. Right? So you need to collect data on many aspects as well. Everything is data-based. Not one is not... Now you understand the difference?

    ……五年之后，十年之后。请记住，对于你们许多分享了为什么在这个课堂上的想法的人来说，五年之后，十年之后，当谈到预见时，你不是在这里准确预测“这就是将会发生的事情”。如果你那样做，你就是在做错误的预见。好吗？五年之后，十年之后，未来可能像这样，或者像那样，或者像这样，或者像那样。你想出或者你描绘未来的不同场景。对吧？而你今天做的是，如果那些未来中的一个成为现实，我将如何准备自己去驾驭它，而不是被甩出去。你明白我的意思吗？所以让我们把它分解到你的个人生活中。好的。如果明天我问你，Karishma，你的一天会是什么样？

    学生：我会在同一时间做另一个模块。

    教授：你会醒来，无论你的日常工作是什么，你会做，然后你会来这里上课。但是如果我问你几个月后的事情，你能说出来吗？

    学生：没那么准确。

    教授：是的。特别是如果我问你关于你的夏天。在六月，六月十五号，你要做什么？

    学生：噢，我妈妈计划去印度，而我爸爸计划去欧洲。

    教授：无论怎样，对吧？如果那要发生，我今天如何准备自己？如果这要发生，我做什么？如果我要找工作，我做什么？所以未来……或者预见完全是关于什么可能是潜在的未来，什么可能是潜在状态之一——或者可能有多种状态——如果其中一种状态发生，我如何准备自己去那里。对吧？当你那样做时，即使那是基于数据的。因为如果你要描绘这个场景可能发生，那个场景可能发生，你也需要收集大量数据。你会收集什么样的数据？你会收集关于……如果你在找工作。你会收集什么样的数据来描绘你的未来场景？

    你甚至可能会看哪些国家做得好。你甚至可能会密切关注特朗普，他在做什么，这样你可以巧妙地避开他去别处寻找，对吧？你可能会看技术如何……AI发生了什么，它是变成一种时尚还是要颠覆你？这是……这是一个困扰许多人的问题。AI是留下来还是离开？对吧？许多问题都在那周围盘旋。当谈到能源系统时，他说太阳能。太阳能是我们需要的方向还是别的什么？它已经成熟了还是饱和了？那是我们将要看的一个问题。还有其他有前途的能源……你知道，你可以押注的替代能源。对吧？所以你也需要在许多方面收集数据。一切都是基于数据的。没有一个不是……现在你明白区别了吗？

  - **22:30 – 26:10: Evolution from Forecasting to Intelligence to Foresighting**

    In the earlier days, people only talked about forecasting. With whatever data they got, they tried to extrapolate for one, two years down the line. It was fine in older days because technology wasn't... or the environment wasn't... wasn't moving so fast, so dramatic. So forecasting was enough. And intelligence is something which many of the top-notch companies in innovation engage in. Because as soon as clues come, you change your business model. You change your customer... the way the customers... For example, right, when... when there was a time when people in the retail sector thought, okay, festive season, Chinese New Year is coming. Which means what? Stock up all your products because there is going to be huge sales, right? But it's not... over time they realized that it's not just festive means more sales, it is also festive season together with people's mindset. Right? If people are very uncertain about their jobs, though it's Chinese New Year, do you think they're going to spend more? Right? So it is not just about festive season, it's about broader socio-economic context also that plays a role in your business. So they started doing intelligent decisions in order to be more agile in the marketplace. That is intelligence. But then they realized all this is not enough, we need to think about... if you want to be in the forefront of innovation, you cannot be always reactive. Oh, this happened today, so I'm reacting to it. This happened today, I'm reacting to that. That cannot be the way if you want to be in the forefront of innovation. So what you do is you want to be the driver of the whole thing. Which means what? You want to see in the future what could be the potential things and then you want to take decisions today so that you are not taken by surprise. You're not thrown out of the business. That's what is foresighting. Yes, Moammar?

    Student: Um, just a query regarding all of this. What we are doing... we'll look at what technologies will be the future... or particular technologies... I mean, not particular technologies but what will be the future technology, but will we take a particular technology and look at how that... the future of that technology will be? For example, since I'm looking at solar, I'm looking at the past two years how the price has drastically dropped from where it was. So something like that also... a particular technology and how the forecast of that technology.

    Professor: There are different levels to foresighting. That's what you would have seen in Carlson's article as well. If you are working on one particular technology or if you are like her, R&D, making R&D decisions. For example, you are investing in solar, you are investing in wind or you are investing in geothermal, right? You want to... you have been investing in solar all along. And now you think, is this the right strategy or not? Then you dive deeper in solar, but you also look at competitor technology and analyze whether it's better for me to invest... continue investing here or invest there. So that is one level wherein within a business unit you are looking at this particular technology. That is one level. But foresighting spans different levels. As I said earlier, it could be a small R&D group, it could be an organization, it could be an industry, it could be a country. That's why this topic is applicable to all levels starting from individuals. That's why I said even if you don't apply the techniques for your company, all the techniques could be applied for the individual level as well, including Knowledge Management. Okay? So the focus can be different. The techniques that you learn will be applicable with cover breadth of it. Good question. Anything else?

    在早期，人们只谈论预测。用他们得到的任何数据，他们试图外推未来一两年。在过去那是可以的，因为技术没有……或者环境没有……没有移动得那么快，那么剧烈。所以预测就足够了。而情报是许多顶尖创新公司从事的事情。因为一旦线索出现，你就改变你的商业模式。你改变你的客户……客户的方式……例如，对吧，当……曾经有一段时间，零售行业的人认为，好的，节日季节，农历新年快到了。这意味着什么？囤积你所有的产品，因为将会有巨大的销售，对吧？但这不仅仅是……随着时间的推移，他们意识到不仅仅是节日意味着更多的销售，也是节日季节加上人们的心态。对吧？如果人们对他们的工作非常不确定，即使是农历新年，你认为他们会花更多钱吗？对吧？所以这不仅仅是关于节日季节，更广泛的社会经济背景也在你的业务中发挥作用。所以他们开始做智能决策，以便在市场上更加敏捷。那就是情报。但后来他们意识到所有这些是不够的，我们需要考虑……如果你想处于创新的前沿，你不能总是被动的。噢，今天发生了这件事，所以我对此做出反应。今天发生了这件事，我对此做出反应。如果你想处于创新的前沿，那不能是方式。所以你要做的是你想成为整件事的驱动者。这意味着什么？你想在未来看到什么可能是潜在的事情，然后你想在今天做出决定，这样你就不会措手不及。你不会被踢出局。那就是预见。是的，Moammar？

    学生：嗯，只是关于所有这些的一个疑问。我们在做的……我们会看什么技术将是未来……或者特定技术……我是说，不是特定技术而是什么是未来技术，但我们会拿一个特定技术来看看那个……那个技术的未来会怎样吗？例如，因为我在看太阳能，我在看过去两年价格是如何从原来的水平急剧下降的。所以类似那样的……一个特定技术以及那个技术的预测。

    教授：预见有不同的层次。这也是你在Carlson的文章中会看到的。如果你在致力于某一项特定技术，或者如果你像她一样，研发，做研发决策。例如，你在投资太阳能，你在投资风能或者你在投资地热能，对吧？你想……你一直都在投资太阳能。现在你想，这是正确的策略吗？然后你深入研究太阳能，但你也看竞争对手的技术并分析对我来说是更好投资……继续在这里投资还是在那里投资。所以那是一个层次，在一个业务单元内你看这个特定的技术。那是一个层次。但预见跨越不同的层次。正如我之前说的，它可以是一个小的研发小组，它可以是一个组织，它可以是一个行业，它可以是一个国家。这就是为什么这个话题适用于从个人开始的所有层次。这就是为什么我说即使你不为你的公司应用这些技术，所有的技术也可以应用于个人层次，包括知识管理。好吗？所以重点可以是不同的。你学习的技术将适用并涵盖它的广度。好问题。还有别的吗？

  - **26:10 – 29:20: Different Levels of Foresighting Application**

    So that's why when I... when I heard you, there are people who talk at technology level. There are people who talk at R&D level. There are people who talk at country level as well. You know, especially those who are in... uh... you, Yi Chun and all, I don't know if you look at country level or industry level. For example, Singapore did something called Industry Transformation Roadmap. Right? This happened what, five years ago? Or six, seven years ago, maybe? It was done for every sector. Right? Every... know... every budget they invest in R&D, they always have... try to see, you know, which industries to bet on, which sectors to bet on. In fact, you know, one of the things which I wanted to share is that NRF is interested in training the civil servants in being futuristic. This is one of the modules which again Chai Kah Hin wants to take it up, right? They want to know what to bet on. So this is done at different levels. Uh... when I told you Koo Seng Meng will be coming next week for guest lecture, he was with NRF when he did this module. He was looking at the country level, right? For different sectors. So there are different people at different levels. Yeah. Any other question? Is this clear? The difference across three things?

    Now, the second thing. Your name, Eugene and Wasyatomo, is it? Noted down. Yeah. Good.

    所以这就是为什么当我……当我听到你们时，有些人是在技术层面上谈论。有些人是在研发层面上谈论。也有人是在国家层面上谈论。你知道，特别是那些在……呃……你，Yi Chun和其他人，我不知道你们是看国家层面还是行业层面。例如，新加坡做了一个叫做行业转型路线图（Industry Transformation Roadmap）的东西。对吧？这是发生在五年前？还是六七年前，也许？它是为每个部门做的。对吧？每一个……知道……他们投资于研发的每一笔预算，他们总是有……试图看，你知道，押注哪些行业，押注哪些部门。事实上，你知道，我想分享的一件事是NRF有兴趣培训公务员具有未来感。这是Chai Kah Hin再次想要接手的模块之一，对吧？他们想知道押注什么。所以这是在不同层面上完成的。呃……当我告诉你们Koo Seng Meng下周会来做客座讲座时，他做这个模块时是在NRF。他在看国家层面，对吧？针对不同的部门。所以在不同层面有不同的人。是的。还有其他问题吗？这个清楚了吗？这三者之间的区别？

    现在，第二件事。你的名字，Eugene和Wasyatomo，是吗？记下了。是的。很好。

  - **29:20 – 32:25: Carlson's Article Discussion and Class Participation Guidelines**

    Now, what Carlson's article say in terms of foresighting and the process and tools involved in it? We will talk in detail about this article, but I just want to give chance for those who really have done hard work to stand out in terms of class participation. Yes. Your name? When you write your name, can you make it bold? Moammar, yours is way too small. I can't see... Your is Jonan, is it?

    Student: Jonan, yeah.

    Professor: Jonan, yeah.

    Student: Uh so what I believe that Carlson said in this article was that... um mainly for foresighting it's a structured and strategic process that identifies and translates emerging technologies into future business opportunities. So his process mainly revolves around uh defining the power zone, then after that creating future options and strategy and R&D integration. And some of the tools he used are like his technology space map, which is basically to broadly classify the technologies of the future, and then after that he can he can better pump in your resources to do your R&D.

    Professor: Okay. So this is where I would want... Okay, maybe I should tell this after giving chance to others. Good. You're there. I would say 50%. Anyone else? Yes.

    Student: I think he laid out the process of doing so, like if you read it, you will say, okay, step one you should do this, do that, step two. And then he also laid out what are the key success metrics that would enable the process to be successful. So for example, that you need like a upper management support. Support. Yeah, support. So he laid out that I guess it won't get above the upper management to get it okay. So there's no point if you don't get the support, then if you do it at the lower level... I mean as what you said at the start, you say not all the tools will be useful in the real life because if you don't have the management support. So I think he laid out the key success metrics as well.

    Professor: Support. Good. Yeah? I would say it's all building on... right? He laid the foundation, she's building on it. Anyone else?

    Student: Apart from what Jonan and Lisa said...

    Professor: Lisa.

    Student: Yes, Lisa. Uh one thing that I really liked reading this article is the process of involving people from cross-functional uh parts of an organ... not only their own organization but industry experts uh consultants so that there's not a group think. So doing that with workshops and then going back to analysis and then bringing them all again as a convergent thinking. So, yeah, so the process was more I would say organized. If I'm working in an organization, it's it's easy to follow rather than it's it's not isolated like that.

    现在，Carlson的文章在预见（foresighting）以及其中涉及的过程和工具方面是怎么说的？我们将详细讨论这篇文章，但我只想给那些真正努力工作的人一个在课堂参与方面脱颖而出的机会。是的。你的名字？当你写名字时，能不能加粗？Moammar，你的太小了。我看不到……你是Jonan，是吗？

    学生：Jonan，是的。

    教授：Jonan，是的。

    学生：呃，所以我认为Carlson在这篇文章中所说的是……嗯，主要是对于预见，它是一个结构化和战略性的过程，识别并将新兴技术转化为未来的商业机会。所以他的过程主要围绕呃定义“力量区”（power zone），然后之后创建未来选项以及战略和研发整合。他使用的一些工具就像他的技术空间图（technology space map），这基本上是为了广泛分类未来的技术，然后之后他可以他可以更好地投入你的资源来做你的研发。

    教授：好的。这是我想要……好的，也许我应该在给其他人机会后再说这个。很好。你到了。我会说50%。还有其他人吗？是的。

    学生：我认为他列出了这样做的过程，就像如果你读它，你会说，好的，第一步你应该做这个，做那个，第二步。然后他还列出了使过程成功的关键成功指标是什么。例如，你需要像上层管理支持。支持。是的，支持。所以他列出了我想如果不得到上层管理的批准就不会通过。所以如果你得不到支持就没有意义，然后如果你在较低层级做……我是说就像你在开始时说的，你说并非所有的工具在现实生活中都有用，因为如果你没有管理层的支持。所以我认为他也列出了关键成功指标。

    教授：支持。很好。是的？我会说这都是建立在……对吧？他奠定了基础，她在其上构建。还有其他人吗？

    学生：除了Jonan和Lisa所说的……

    教授：Lisa。

    学生：是的，Lisa。呃，我真的很喜欢阅读这篇文章的一点是涉及来自组织跨职能……不仅仅是他们自己的组织，还有行业专家、顾问的过程，这样就没有群体思维。所以通过研讨会做那个，然后回到分析，然后再把他们都带回来作为一个趋同思维。所以，是的，所以这个过程更多我会说是有组织的。如果我在一个组织工作，这很容易遵循，而不是像那样孤立。

  - **32:25 – 35:20: Facilitation and Process Structure**

    Professor: So these decision makers are not working in silos saying, "Hey, I'm going to decide on this, go for it." No, that's not how it is done. If at all... Anyone else who wants to share in? Anything else?

    Student: Can I just...

    Professor: Yes.

    Student: Add on.

    Professor: And your name?

    Student: My name is Long. I like the mention about choosing the right facilitator. Yeah, the process facilitator. He has to be respected, subject matter expert at least, and able to bring people uh together, having that divergent and convergent thinking. And when to facilitate whatever process to ensure they achieve the entire business goals.

    Professor: Right. They play an important role. Yes. So in a nutshell, what they say is foresighting is all about carrying out a process. I want you to bear in mind. Foresighting is not about telling "this is what you can expect in future." Foresighting is about a process which enables a firm to be prepared for one of the possible futures. And how do you do it? This is how you do it. It is a structured process which involves many people. And it is aligned with the strategy of the company because what happens is, in a company, first the decision makers should think and value foresighting. In many organizations, it doesn't happen. They think, okay, we are running the show, what's a big deal? We are fine. They move on. Only to realize that something is coming as a shock to hit them. Okay, many companies, organizations unfortunately run that way, especially small and medium enterprises. They are worried about their current bread and butter. You can't expect them to be futuristic. That is why Singapore is very good in the sense they are expecting A*STAR and all to handhold these SMEs to say, "Hey, they cannot think about their future. You help them to prepare them for future." They conduct and handhold, run a workshop saying, "You're working in this, but future is there, you'll be thrown out of business, so try to change." And they do lot of programs to support them. If you're in a large organization, you have the luxury to engage in foresighting but not many bosses understand the value of it. We'll talk more about it in future. Because they think it is like wasting time. Trust me, you know, many of the foresighting activity and processes and workshops happen in a resort, in a spa, in a cool environment. Bringing in people. And they look at it as cost to the organization. They look at it... nothing tangible comes out of it. What is the KPI? What have you met? If they keep asking this question, you cannot exactly show. Unless you do due diligence. Next week we are going to look at how do you show the value of foresighting to your bosses to convince that this is very vital for your company, otherwise you'll be thrown out of business. Next week we look at it.

    教授：所以这些决策者不是在孤岛中工作说，“嘿，我要决定这个，去吧。”不，不是那样做的。如果有的话……还有其他人想分享吗？还有什么吗？

    学生：我能不能只是……

    教授：是的。

    学生：补充。

    教授：你的名字？

    学生：我叫Long。我喜欢关于选择合适的引导者（facilitator）的提及。是的，过程引导者。他必须受到尊重，至少是主题专家，并且能够把人们呃聚集在一起，拥有那种发散和趋同思维。以及何时引导任何过程以确保他们实现整个业务目标。

    教授：对。他们扮演着重要角色。是的。简而言之，他们说的是预见完全是关于执行一个过程。我要你们记住。预见不是关于告诉“这是你在未来可以期待的”。预见是关于一个使公司能够为可能的未来之一做好准备的过程。那你怎么做呢？这就是你怎么做的。它是一个涉及许多人的结构化过程。而且它与公司的战略一致，因为发生的情况是，在一个公司里，首先决策者应该思考并重视预见。在许多组织中，这并没有发生。他们认为，好的，我们在运营，有什么大不了的？我们要好。他们继续前进。直到意识到有什么东西作为一个冲击来打击他们。好的，许多公司、组织不幸是以那种方式运行的，特别是中小企业。他们担心他们目前的生计。你不能期望他们具有未来感。这就是为什么新加坡很好，在这个意义上他们期望A*STAR等等去扶持这些中小企业说，“嘿，他们不能考虑他们的未来。你帮助他们为未来做准备。”他们进行并扶持，举办研讨会说，“你们在这个领域工作，但未来在那里，你们会被踢出局，所以尝试改变。”他们做了很多项目来支持他们。如果你在一个大型组织中，你有奢侈去从事预见，但并不是很多老板理解它的价值。我们将来会更多地讨论它。因为他们认为这就像浪费时间。相信我，你知道，许多预见活动和过程以及研讨会发生在一个度假村，在一个水疗中心，在一个很酷的环境中。把人带进来。他们把它看作是对组织的成本。他们看它……没有什么有形的东西从中出来。KPI是什么？你达到了什么？如果他们一直问这个问题，你无法确切展示。除非你做尽职调查。下周我们将看看如何向你的老板展示预见的价值，以说服这对你的公司至关重要，否则你会被踢出局。下周我们看这个。

  - **35:20 – 38:00: The Power Zone and Workshop Methodology**

    So what you need to do is, the boss has to agree this is important, and engage in the process of calling people from diverse background, have a facilitator to moderate it who commands respect, and then goes through workshop. There are two workshops that Carlson's article mentions. And there are many tools like technology space matrix, the power zone centroid, everything. All these tools, trust me, I was working with a colleague for wind turbine on solar... you know, competitor, in laying out forecasting foresighting for them, and all we did was simple Excel sheet. You don't need fancy tools. You don't need large database and run analysis. Sometimes it is just a question of having simple Excel sheet, having a proper template of what you want, seeking opinion and analyzing it. That's good enough. And if you look at technology space matrix and all, these are all very subjective. Companies use different tools and techniques. That's why I said if I were to teach certain tools... if I were to spend all my energy today teaching about the the different tools used in Carlson's article, it's a waste of your time and my time. Because today it is this, tomorrow when you join a company they are going to use a different tool or you are going to devise a different one which is context specific for the company. So don't waste your time on tools going by... When I give you article, don't waste your time on understanding all the tools and techniques because you should be aware that such a tool exists. That's enough for this module. Okay, there is something called this, this is how it's broadly done. That's about it. Don't break your head on it. Okay? That's where you want to extrapolate the article. Look at what is more important than wasting your time in nitty-gritty details. Don't do that. You cannot afford to do that in technology intelligence unless you are doing the analysis job. An analyst? Yes, they need to worry about it. Okay? Now, what you need to do is as a boss and as you have called in a facilitator, you create an environment for people to come and meet, and they always start from where they are, what they are. That's where the power zone comes. What is that which defines me today? What are my core strengths? What are my capabilities? What are my assets? Okay? And then you this is also out of workshop, right? Because different people think the firm is defined as certain thing in different ways. For you, you might think you know this module is big good because it helps me in analyzing tools. He might think it's because it helps me in decision making, right? Different people have difference. That's why you come together to define what is my core. That's where the bosses also play a role with the strategic vision. Then once they define the current state... okay, if you look at me, me as a faculty, here I am, I'm a tenured professor at NUS, I'm good with teaching, my research and my services. That's me as my... the three pillars that I have. Right? Then at the end of the workshop, you carve out a nice neat question of where you want to go. Because if you were to be futuristic with an open-ended question, it's endless. Right? So that's where the bosses try to define or frame a question which is going to be the anchoring point...

    所以你需要做的是，老板必须同意这很重要，并参与召集来自不同背景的人的过程，让一位受人尊敬的引导者来主持，然后通过研讨会。Carlson的文章提到了两个研讨会。还有很多工具，如技术空间矩阵（technology space matrix）、力量区质心（power zone centroid）等等。所有这些工具，相信我，我和一位同事为风力涡轮机关于太阳能……你知道，竞争对手，为他们制定预测预见，我们所做的只是简单的Excel表格。你不需要花哨的工具。你不需要大型数据库和运行分析。有时这只是一个拥有简单Excel表格，拥有你想要的适当模板，寻求意见并分析它的问题。这就足够了。如果你看技术空间矩阵等等，这些都是非常主观的。公司使用不同的工具和技术。这就是为什么我说如果我要教某些工具……如果我今天要花所有的精力教关于Carlson文章中使用的不同工具，那是浪费你的时间和我的时间。因为今天它是这个，明天当你加入一家公司时，他们会使用不同的工具，或者你要设计一个针对公司具体情况的不同工具。所以不要把时间浪费在工具上……当我给你文章时，不要把时间浪费在理解所有的工具和技术上，因为你应该知道这种工具存在。这就足够这个模块了。好的，有这种东西，这是大概怎么做的。大概就是这样。不要在这上面伤脑筋。好吗？那是你想要外推文章的地方。看看什么比把时间浪费在细枝末节上更重要。不要那样做。除非你在做分析工作，否则你在技术情报中承担不起那样做。分析师？是的，他们需要担心这个。好吗？现在，你需要做的是作为老板，并且你已经叫来了一位引导者，你为人们创造一个环境来见面，他们总是从他们在哪里，他们是什么开始。这就是力量区（power zone）出现的地方。什么是今天定义我的东西？我的核心优势是什么？我的能力是什么？我的资产是什么？好吗？然后你这也是出于研讨会，对吧？因为不同的人认为公司以不同的方式被定义为某种东西。对于你，你可能认为你知道这个模块很好因为它帮助我分析工具。他可能认为这是因为它帮助我做决策，对吧？不同的人有差异。这就是为什么你们聚在一起来定义什么是我的核心。这就是老板们通过战略愿景也发挥作用的地方。然后一旦他们定义了当前状态……好的，如果你看我，我作为一个教员，我在这里，我是NUS的终身教授，我擅长教学，我的研究和我的服务。那是作为我的……我拥有的三个支柱。对吧？然后在研讨会结束时，你精心设计一个你想去哪里的漂亮简洁的问题。因为如果你要用一个开放式问题来展望未来，那是无止境的。对吧？所以这就是老板们试图定义或构建一个将成为锚点的问题的地方……

  - **38:00 - 39:29: Defining the Framework for Foresight**

    ...for that team to think about foresight. For example, this question will be: I have been betting on solar technology. Does it make sense for me to invest more in this as a company, or should I not? That could be a question for this company. For me, I have been doing teaching, research, and service as a tenured professor in NUS. Is it okay to continue in this trajectory, or is AI going to disrupt the whole industry so much that I need to completely revamp my skill set? That could be a framing question for me.

    So, at the end of the first workshop, you need to, as bosses, you need to define what is the framework which is going to define your foresight. If you leave it open-ended saying, "I want to be competitive five years down the line," it's too vague. Right? Or it could be what many of you mentioned about AI: Is AI going to disrupt my industry [such] that I need to quickly revamp my workforce on AI-related tools and techniques? That could be a broad question. Or is it a fad for my industry?

    ……讓那個團隊去思考前瞻性（Foresight）。例如，這個問題可能是：我一直押注於太陽能技術。作為一家公司，我是否有意義繼續在此投入更多資金，還是不應該？這可能是這家公司的一個問題。對我來說：作為新加坡國立大學（NUS）的終身教授，我一直從事教學、研究和服務工作。繼續沿著這個軌跡發展是可以的嗎？還是說人工智慧（AI）會徹底顛覆整個行業，以至於我需要完全重塑我的技能組合？這可能是我的一個框架性問題。

    因此，在第一次研討會結束時，作為老闆，你們需要定義將用來界定你們前瞻性工作的框架是什麼。如果你們留一個開放式的結尾，說“我想在五年後保持競爭力”，這太模糊了。對吧？或者它可以是你們許多人提到的關於 AI 的問題：AI 是否會顛覆我的行業，以至於我需要快速讓我的員工掌握 AI 相關的工具和技術？這可能是一個廣泛的問題。或者這對我的行業來說只是一時的熱潮？

  - **39:29 - 40:46: Gathering Data and Analyzing the Future**

    So you come up with a broad question and you ask these people to go and collect more data to analyze it, so that you can carve out potential future. Right? At least this particular article... it's more of an old article, but I'm telling you what this article says. It's not about carving the future; it's talking about three important decisions. What are the three important decisions? Based on the two workshops. The first workshop I already told you: what is your Power Zone. And then at the end of the thing, they are going to carve out and go and collect more data about the future.

    You're going to go and study... if you're in the education industry, what all data you will gather? Maybe let's do a group activity. I was planning for one. This is how I start the whole class: I decided to not use the slides today. I usually use slides, knowing me from [module] 5007, but today I thought I will grab your attention, I won't use the slide. So I'm just going through the whole lecture without the slides.

    所以你們提出一個廣泛的問題，然後要求這些人去收集更多的數據並進行分析，以便你們能夠描繪出潛在的未來。對吧？至少這篇特定的文章……這是一篇比較舊的文章，但我是在告訴你們這篇文章講了什麼。它不是關於描繪未來，而是討論了三個重要的決定。哪三個重要的決定？基於這兩次研討會。第一次研討會我已經告訴過你們了：你們的“實力區”（Power Zone）是什麼。然後在結束時，他們將制定計畫並去收集更多關於未來的數據。

    你們要去研究……如果你們在教育行業，你們會收集什麼數據？也許我們來做一個小組活動。我本來就計畫了一個。這就是我開始這堂課的方式：我今天決定不使用投影片。認識我（上過 5007 模組）的人都知道我通常會用投影片，但今天我想抓住你們的注意力，我不會用投影片。所以我將在沒有投影片的情況下講完整堂課。

  - **40:46 - 43:07: The Classroom Activity: NUS in 2032**

    So let's do one thing, let's take a break and do this class activity. The class activity... hopefully you all form a group by then. For this module, let's have a group of say five to six members. And you need not stick to the same group for your group project. Of course, group project is there, you have to have a group, but today you can form any group that you want. See if you are in synergy with the groupmates. So form a group of five to six members, and I want you to do this activity after the break.

    Wherein you are going to be hired by Prof Tan, our President of NUS, and he is going to say... he is going to frame you this question: "What kind of classrooms should NUS have in 2032?" You as intelligence officers/analysts, you are going to help Tan with this question. Can you?

    And bear in mind whatever I said: Foresighting is a process. It is not prediction. In the past, before I gave all this background, I asked students to do this activity. And trust me, many groups will come up with the answer saying, "In 2032, there are going to be more AIs, there are going to be hologram professors, blah blah blah, AI bots, chatbots as teaching assistants, etc." Trust me, that's not called foresighting. If you were to take that to Prof Tan, he is going to throw it back at you.

    So, you need to understand foresighting is a process. And I also told you, foresighting is about painting future scenarios for which you need to collect data. What kind of data you will collect? What kind of process you will undertake? That is going to be the focus of your group activity. Is this clear? Don't tell me the final outcome of [the] classroom, that's what I don't want. I want you to walk through how Prof Tan... if he were to answer this question, how he would engage in intelligence activities. That's what I want you to focus on. Is this clear to everybody? Everyone? Let's do it after a short break. Let's come back by 7:35. And then we'll do this quick one and then we'll move on to... Okay.

    那我們做一件事，我們先休息一下，然後進行這個課堂活動。課堂活動……希望那時候你們都已經組好隊了。對於這個模組，我們一組大約五到六名成員。你們不必為了這個小組項目而堅持跟同一組人在一起。當然，小組項目是有的，你們必須有一個小組，但今天你們可以隨意組隊。看看你們是否與組員有協同效應。所以組成一個五到六人的小組，我希望你們在休息後進行這個活動。

    在這個活動中，你們將被 NUS 校長 Tan 教授聘用，他會說……他會給你們提出這個問題：“2032 年的新加坡國立大學應該擁有什麼樣的教室？”作為情報官員/分析師，你們要幫助 Tan 教授解決這個問題。可以嗎？

    請記住我說過的話：前瞻（Foresighting）是一個過程。它不是預測。過去，在我提供所有這些背景知識之前，我讓學生做過這個活動。相信我，許多小組會給出的答案是：“在 2032 年，會有更多的 AI，會有全息影像教授，等等等等，AI 機器人，聊天機器人助教等等。”相信我，那不叫前瞻。如果你們把那個拿給 Tan 教授看，他會把它扔回給你們。

    所以，你們需要明白前瞻是一個過程。而且我也告訴過你們，前瞻是關於描繪未來的場景，為此你們需要收集數據。你們會收集什麼樣的數據？你們將採取什麼樣的過程？這將是你們小組活動的重點。清楚了嗎？不要告訴我教室的最終結果，這不是我想要的。我希望你們展示如果 Tan 教授要回答這個問題，他該如何進行情報活動。這就是我希望你們關注的重點。大家清楚了嗎？所有人？我們在短暫休息後開始。我們 7:35 回來。然後我們會快速做完這個，接著我們會繼續……好的。

  - **01:00:00 - 01:00:46: The Role of the Analyst and Interfacing with Decision Makers**

    **Professor**: ...have tons of things to look at. So your job as analyst is to first go and ask the decision maker: what is your intention basically? If he says this is a problem I want to tackle it at least in two years, three years down the line, then your problem statement is perfectly fine. That's where as, at the bottom as analyst, you should always interface with your decision maker to understand what does he or she wants. Right? If they give a question like that, it is your job to go and ponder about it. If you take the question as given and assume something and do, that's not right. Right? You as consultants need to work with your clients, and in this case, it's Prof Tan. Nothing wrong. Good that you developed it further by looking at what they are doing. You want to share more? Yeah. Is that clear to everyone? That's why I said in... in Week 4 I'll tell you a framework wherein... that's why I said it's... this module is important for R&D analyst, intelligence analyst as well as decision makers because you should see the connection happening. If not, everything will fall apart. Yeah. Go further.

    ...有很多东西需要通过。所以作为分析师，你的工作首先是去询问决策者：你的意图到底是什么？如果他说这是一个我想在至少两三年后解决的问题，那么你的问题陈述就完全没有问题。这就是作为底层的分析师，你应该始终与决策者沟通，了解他或她想要什么的地方。对吧？如果他们给出那样一个问题，你的工作就是去仔细思考它。如果你直接接受问题并基于假设去执行，那是不对的。对吧？作为顾问，你需要与你的客户合作，在这种情况下就是陈教授（Prof Tan）。这没错。很好，你通过观察他们正在做的事情进一步拓展了它。你想分享更多吗？好的。大家都清楚了吗？这就是为什么我说在...在第四周我会告诉你们一个框架，其中...这就是为什么我说...这个模块对研发分析师、情报分析师以及决策者都很重要，因为你们应该看到其中的联系。否则，一切都会分崩离析。好的。继续。

  - **01:00:46 - 01:01:17: Discussing Future Scenarios (Student Response)**

    **Student**: This involves the different possible scenarios that could happen in five to seven years. One could be the focus is more on tech jobs. One was more on entrepreneurship... like NUS [inaudible at 00:58] just running his specific startup. So then with all of these [inaudible at 01:03] scenarios as well. And then we talked about a... [Student 2 speaks] ...population. I mean, they want benefit for the possible future.

    **Professor**: Yeah. You should also talk about futures to this. Currently in schools and education policies

    **学生**: 这涉及未来五到七年可能发生的不同情景。一种可能是重点更多地放在科技工作上。另一种更多是关于创业精神... 就像新加坡国立大学（NUS）[00:58 处听不清] 只是经营他特定的初创公司。所以，结合所有这些 [01:03 处听不清] 情景。然后我们要谈论一个... [学生2发言] ...人口。我的意思是，他们希望为可能的未来获益。

    **教授**: 是的。你也应该谈谈这方面的未来。目前在学校和教育政策中

  - **01:10:00 - 01:10:27: Wrapping up Student Discussion**

    **Professor**: ...population. I mean, they want benefit for the possible future. This is how I wanted you all to think. Yeah. I jumped the gun too early. Can we move on, in the interest of time?

    ...人口。我的意思是，他们希望为可能的未来获益。这就是我希望你们思考的方式。是的。我太早下结论了。为了节省时间，我们可以继续吗？

  - **01:10:27 - 01:10:54: Technology Foresight Ignores the Present?**

    **Professor**: [Reading Quiz Question] Technology foresight ignores present and looks only at future. If you have been listening, you will know the answer. You cannot ignore the present. You should know where you are. Foresighting is all about... you should know where you are now, what are the potential futures that can pan out, and try to find a way that you can be there five years, ten years down the line. You need to navigate the way today.

    [阅读测验问题] 技术预见忽略现在，只看未来。如果你一直在听，你会知道答案。你不能忽略现在。你应该知道你在哪里。预见就是关于... 你应该知道你现在在哪里，未来有哪些可能的情景，并试图找到一条路，让你在五年、十年后到达那里。你需要从今天开始导航。

  - **01:10:54 - 01:11:21: Is Foresight a One-time Activity?**

    **Professor**: Technology foresight is... this is a very important question. It's a one-time activity, ongoing process, or both?

    技术预见是... 这是一个非常重要的问题。它是一次性活动，持续的过程，还是两者兼而有之？

  - **01:20:00 - 01:22:45: Applying Foresight to Strategy**

    **Professor**: ...identify new opportunities. So I can enhance it, or I can extend it. Say, for example, I'm doing research only on technology management. Maybe I should extend it to knowledge management. Or maybe I should extend it to open innovation. Or maybe I should extend it to sustainability. So that's extension of my power zone. Or completely new opportunities. I stop being a professor, I go become an entrepreneur. I take my research and translate it into a startup. That's a completely new opportunity for me. And that decision I make based on the foresight exercise. That's what the article says.

    Is this clear to everybody? The three outcomes? And the three outcomes are very important. Why? Why do you think identifying these three outcomes are important? Why can't I just say, okay, I'll do whatever I want?

    **Student**: [Inaudible answer about resources/direction]

    **Professor**: Exactly. To allocate resources. If I want to start a company, I need different kinds of resources. If I want to extend my research to sustainability, I need to hire people who are experts in sustainability, or I need to collaborate with people in sustainability. So the resource allocation depends on these three outcomes. And that's why you need to be very clear on what you want to achieve.

    Is this clear? Any questions so far?

    **Student**: [Inaudible question]

    **Professor**: Yeah.

    **Student**: [Inaudible question about power zone]

    **Professor**: Correct.

    **Student**: [Inaudible question about dynamic capabilities]

    **Professor**: Very good question. Power zone is your current capability. Dynamic capability is how you evolve your capability over time. So power zone is a static snapshot of what you are good at today. Dynamic capability is the process of changing that power zone. Very good question. We will cover dynamic capabilities later in the module. It's a very important concept in strategic management. But for now, just think of power zone as your current strength. What are you good at today? What pays your bills today? That's your power zone. Okay?

    **教授**: ...识别新机会。所以我可以增强它，或者我可以扩展它。比如说，我只做技术管理的研究。也许我应该把它扩展到知识管理。或者也许我应该把它扩展到开放式创新。或者也许我应该把它扩展到可持续性。那是对我权力区域的扩展。或者是全新的机会。我不再当教授，我去当企业家。我把我的研究转化为一家初创公司。对我来说那是全新的机会。而那个决定是我基于预见练习做出的。这就是文章所说的。

    大家都清楚了吗？这三个结果？这三个结果非常重要。为什么？你们认为为什么识别这三个结果很重要？为什么我不能只说，好吧，我想做什么就做什么？

    **学生**: [关于资源/方向的回答听不清]

    **教授**: 正是。为了分配资源。如果我想开一家公司，我需要不同种类的资源。如果我想把我的研究扩展到可持续性，我需要雇佣可持续性方面的专家，或者我需要与可持续性领域的人合作。所以资源分配取决于这三个结果。这就是为什么你需要非常清楚你想要实现什么。

    清楚了吗？到目前为止有什么问题吗？

    **学生**: [问题听不清]

    **教授**: 是的。

    **学生**: [关于权力区域的问题听不清]

    **教授**: 正确。

    **学生**: [关于动态能力的问题听不清]

    **教授**: 很好的问题。权力区域是你目前的能力。动态能力是你如何随着时间演变你的能力。所以权力区域是你今天擅长什么的静态快照。动态能力是改变那个权力区域的过程。很好的问题。我们稍后会在模块中涵盖动态能力。它是战略管理中一个非常重要的概念。但现在，只把权力区域想成是你目前的优势。你今天擅长什么？今天什么为你支付账单？那就是你的权力区域。好吗？

  - **01:22:45 - 01:25:06: Intelligence vs. Foresight**

    **Professor**: Okay. So let's move on. We talked about foresight. Now let's talk about intelligence. What is intelligence? How is it different from foresight? Or are they the same?

    **Student**: [Inaudible answer]

    **Professor**: Okay. Intelligence is about information. Foresight is about future scenarios. Okay. Anybody else?

    **Student**: [Inaudible answer about actionable insights]

    **Professor**: Actionable insights. Very good. Intelligence leads to actionable insights. Foresight leads to future scenarios. But aren't future scenarios actionable? If I say in 2032 classrooms will be like this, isn't that actionable? I can start building that classroom today.

    **Student**: [Inaudible answer]

    **Professor**: Okay. So let's look at the definition. Intelligence warns an organization of technological threats and identifies potential technological opportunities. It's about managing technologies, present and emerging, from both inside and outside the company. It's like a radar. You're constantly scanning. Scanning for what? Threats and opportunities.

    And it transforms gathered information into intelligence. So information is just raw data. Intelligence is processed data that is useful for decision making. That's the key difference. Information is everywhere. Google gives you information. But Google doesn't give you intelligence. You have to process that information, put it in context, analyze it, and then it becomes intelligence.

    Is this clear? The difference between data, information, and intelligence?

    Data is raw numbers. Information is data with context. Intelligence is information with analysis and implications.

    So, for example, if I say the temperature is 30 degrees. That's data. If I say the temperature is 30 degrees, it's hot today. That's information. If I say the temperature is 30 degrees, it's hot today, so people will buy more ice cream, so I should stock up on ice cream. That's intelligence.

    You see the difference? It leads to action. Decision making.

    And foresight... foresight is about looking further ahead. Intelligence is usually about the here and now, or the near future. Foresight is about the long term. Five years, ten years, twenty years. And it involves more uncertainty. Intelligence tries to reduce uncertainty. Foresight embraces uncertainty. It says, okay, there are multiple futures. I don't know which one will happen, but I can prepare for all of them. Or I can try to shape the future I want.

    So they are related, but they are distinct. Intelligence feeds into foresight. You need good intelligence to do good foresight. But foresight goes beyond intelligence. It adds imagination, creativity, scenario planning.

    Okay? So that's the key distinction.

    **教授**: 好的。那我们继续。我们谈论了预见。现在我们来谈谈情报。什么是情报？它与预见有何不同？还是说它们是一样的？

    **学生**: [回答听不清]

    **教授**: 好的。情报是关于信息。预见是关于未来情景。好的。还有其他人吗？

    **学生**: [关于可操作见解的回答听不清]

    **教授**: 可操作的见解。非常好。情报导致可操作的见解。预见导致未来情景。但是未来情景不是可操作的吗？如果我说 2032 年教室会是这样，那不是可操作的吗？我今天就可以开始建造那个教室。

    **学生**: [回答听不清]

    **教授**: 好的。那我们来看看定义。情报警告组织技术威胁并识别潜在的技术机会。它是关于管理技术，现在的和新兴的，来自公司内部和外部。它就像雷达。你在不断扫描。扫描什么？威胁和机会。

    并且它将收集到的信息转化为情报。所以信息只是原始数据。情报是经过处理的、对决策有用的数据。那是关键区别。信息无处不在。谷歌给你信息。但谷歌不给你情报。你必须处理那些信息，把它放在背景中，分析它，然后它才变成情报。

    清楚了吗？数据、信息和情报之间的区别？

    数据是原始数字。信息是带有背景的数据。情报是带有分析和含义的信息。

    所以，例如，如果我说气温是 30 度。那是数据。如果我说气温是 30 度，今天很热。那是信息。如果我说气温是 30 度，今天很热，所以人们会买更多冰淇淋，所以我应该储备冰淇淋。那是情报。

    你看到区别了吗？它导致行动。决策。

    而预见... 预见是关于看得更远。情报通常是关于此时此地，或不久的将来。预见是关于长期。五年，十年，二十年。并且它涉及更多不确定性。情报试图减少不确定性。预见拥抱不确定性。它说，好的，有多种未来。我不知道哪一种会发生，但我可以为所有这些做准备。或者我可以试图塑造我想要的未来。

    所以它们是相关的，但它们是不同的。情报输入到预见中。你需要好的情报来做好的预见。但预见超越了情报。它增加了想象力、创造力、情景规划。

    好吗？所以那是关键区别。

  - **01:20:00 - 01:21:21: Closing Remarks and Next Steps**

    **Professor**: ...with that I'll stop my lecture today. I know it's been a long day for you all. But I hope you found this session useful. At least getting an introduction to what this module is about, what foresighting is, what intelligence is.

    So next week, we will have a guest lecture. Mr. Koo Seng Meng from AI Singapore. He will talk about "Technology Intelligence: Why & Practice". He will share his experience from AI Singapore, how they do intelligence, why it is important for them. It will be a very interesting session. I encourage you all to come prepared with questions.

    And also, please form your groups for the class activity. You can start discussing the "NUS in 2032" topic. We will do the activity next week after the guest lecture. So come prepared with some initial thoughts.

    And also, please go through the reading materials for next week. It will help you understand the guest lecture better.

    Okay? Any final questions?

    **Student**: [Inaudible question about group size]

    **Professor**: Five to six members. Yeah. Five to six members per group.

    **Student**: [Inaudible question]

    **Professor**: Yes, you can. You can have members from different backgrounds. That's actually better. Diverse perspectives.

    Okay. If no more questions, thank you all. Have a good evening. See you next week.

    **教授**: ...今天的讲座就到这里。我知道这对大家来说是漫长的一天。但我希望你们觉得这节课有用。至少对这个模块是关于什么的，什么是预见，什么是情报有了一个初步了解。

    下周，我们将有一场客座讲座。来自新加坡人工智能（AI Singapore）的 Koo Seng Meng 先生。他将谈论“技术情报：原因与实践”。他将分享他在新加坡人工智能的经验，他们如何做情报，为什么这对他们很重要。这将是一个非常有趣的会议。我鼓励大家准备好问题。

    另外，请为课堂活动组建你们的小组。你们可以开始讨论“2032 年的新加坡国立大学”这个话题。我们将在下周客座讲座后进行这个活动。所以请带着一些初步的想法来。

    还有，请阅读下周的阅读材料。这将帮助你们更好地理解客座讲座。

    好吗？还有最后的问题吗？

    **学生**: [关于小组规模的问题听不清]

    **教授**: 五到六名成员。是的。每组五到六名成员。

    **学生**: [问题听不清]

    **教授**: 是的，你可以。你可以有来自不同背景的成员。那实际上更好。多样化的视角。

    好的。如果没有更多问题，谢谢大家。祝大家晚上愉快。下周见。
## Week 2
  [18:05–18:07] **Class setup, participation rules, and agenda**
  **English** Today we’ll do it a bit differently so there’s more synergy within each group. It will be a group challenge rather than purely individual work. If your group genuinely feels there are free-riders, let me know. Likewise, if someone clearly explored the topic much more deeply and became a key contributor, tell me as well—so they can receive extra points.
  For today’s agenda: we’ll start with a quick summary of last week, then we’ll have our guest segment, and finally we’ll discuss technology intelligence and foresighting—especially *why it is important*. That “why” is what the benchmarking report is mainly about.

  **Chinese** 今天我们换一种方式，让小组内部更有“协同感”。会更像小组挑战，而不只是个人输出。
  如果你们小组确实觉得有人在“搭便车”，可以私下告诉我；反过来，如果有人明显做得更深入、贡献更关键，也请告诉我，我会给额外加分。
  今天流程是：先快速回顾上周内容 → 然后是嘉宾分享 → 最后讨论技术情报（TI）与远见/前瞻（foresighting），重点是：**为什么它重要**。这也是今天 benchmarking report 的核心。

  [18:06–18:07] **Last week recap prompt + forum posting guidance**
  **English** Any questions from last week—what foresighting is, and Carlson’s article? I noticed there were quite a few non-ChatGPT discussion posts on the forum, which is good. But there was also a strange random post under the “ChatGPT” area and I couldn’t identify who posted it.
  Also, the number of posts has gone down (that’s fine). I’m not opening new posts for this week; the forum activity will continue until next week. Please contribute more, but focus on quality.
  One more point: I didn’t set up the Canvas page for people to post figures. If you have a block diagram or mind map, can you post it on Canvas? Then I’ll go back to checking the forum for both ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT discussions. If you have any difficulties with the module, raise them early—don’t wait until the end of the semester.

  **Chinese** 上周内容有没有问题？比如：什么是 foresighting，以及 Carlson 那篇文章？
  我看到论坛里有不少“非 ChatGPT”的讨论贴，挺好。但也出现了一个很奇怪的“ChatGPT 区”的随机贴，我找不到是谁发的。
  另外，这周帖子数量下降也没关系。我这周不会再开新的讨论区，论坛讨论会延续到下周。请继续发，但更强调**质量**。
  还有：我之前没在 Canvas 上专门开“图表/框图/思维导图”的提交位置。如果你做了框图或 mind map，可以发在 Canvas 上。之后我会同时看论坛里 ChatGPT 和非 ChatGPT 的内容。
  课程有任何困难请尽早说，别拖到学期末才反馈。

  [18:07–18:09] **Quick conceptual check: foresighting vs crisis management**
  **English** Let’s answer a few quick questions. First: is foresighting the same as crisis management?
  No. Crisis management is about solving immediate, pressing problems. It’s reactive. Foresighting is long-term and proactive: you’re dealing with future-oriented problems, mitigating threats *and* identifying opportunities. Crisis management is usually about mitigating threats in the short term, not about opening up future opportunities.

  **Chinese** 我们先用几个问题做“概念校准”。第一个：foresighting 是不是等同于 crisis management（危机管理）？
  不是。危机管理解决的是**眼前的紧急问题**，偏被动、反应式；foresighting 面向**更长期**，偏主动：既要降低未来威胁，也要抓住未来机会。危机管理通常只关注短期“止损”，而不是系统性布局机会。

  [18:09–18:11] **Is TI/foresight purely “technology”? + broader lenses including ethics**
  **English** Next: is technology intelligence and foresighting purely a “technology-only” exercise? If you Google “technology intelligence,” you’ll also see competitor intelligence, social intelligence, etc.
  The answer is: it used to be narrower when time horizons were short and the scope was limited. But when the time horizon becomes longer, you must look beyond technology: market, social factors, environmental factors, and human behavior. (Think back to the classroom-of-the-future exercise—learning behavior matters.)
  And one more lens that many people forget: ethics. Ethics should be part and parcel of technology assessment—especially in AI. Many of you working on AI will have encountered AI ethics; it matters at the system and societal level, and it needs to be included in how we assess and steer technology.

  **Chinese** 下一个问题：技术情报/前瞻是不是纯粹“只看技术”的事情？
  以前在**时间跨度短、范围窄**时，可能更像只看技术。但只要时间跨度拉长，你必须把视角扩展到：市场、社会、环境、人的行为等。（比如你们做“未来课堂”的活动，本质上就离不开学习行为。）
  另外一个经常被忽略的维度：**伦理**。伦理不应该缺席技术评估，尤其是 AI。做 AI 的同学基本都接触过 AI ethics——它会影响技术能不能被接受、能不能规模化落地，所以应该进入评估框架。

  [18:11–18:14] **Top-down vision vs structured process (Delphi)**
  **English** Another question raised on the forum: is foresighting basically a visionary leader giving directions—top-down speculation?
  A visionary leader can help, and foresight can be triggered top-down or bottom-up. But foresighting is fundamentally a *process* involving people with different skills and perspectives (R&D, business unit managers, etc.).
  If it’s only one leader driving it, it may work only if that person is unusually accurate—which is rare. If the leader leaves, the system can collapse. Worse, if that leader is strongly opinionated but wrong, the company gets locked into the wrong direction. This often happens in SMEs where the leader decides because they lack bandwidth.
  That does not mean “ignore visionaries.” In fact, foresight has methods like the **Delphi method**: systematically collecting opinions from *multiple* experts/leaders, iterating toward areas of consensus, and combining qualitative and quantitative evidence—rather than letting a single person dictate the future.

  **Chinese** 论坛里还有一个常见误解：foresighting 是不是“有个远见型领导拍板”，纯自上而下的推演？
  领导的远见当然重要，foresight 也可以自上而下启动，或者自下而上从一线发现信号。但本质上它是一个**流程**：要把不同角色（研发、业务单元、市场等）的视角整合起来。
  如果完全靠一个人带方向，只有在这个人极其“天才且持续正确”时才可能成功，但这很少见；领导离开后体系可能断掉；更糟的是领导如果强势但判断错，公司会被锁死在错误方向。中小企业确实常这样运行，因为资源不足。
  但这不等于不要专家/远见者。相反，foresight 里有 **Delphi 方法**：让多个专家/行业领导分轮次给判断、不断收敛共识，并结合定量与定性证据，而不是“一言堂”。

  [18:14–18:15] **Where ethics fits in foresight**
  **English** How does ethics come in? One way is as a guiding principle: it supports transparency and legitimacy, and clarifies what values the organization wants to advance.
  At what stage should ethics appear—early, mid, late? Ideally, it should be introduced early enough to define “what we are moving toward” and what is out of bounds. Detailed assessment can be refined later, but shared ethical direction prevents teams from optimizing toward a future that becomes unacceptable or non-adoptable.

  **Chinese** 伦理在 foresight 里怎么“落位”？一种很实用的理解是：伦理是一套**指导原则**，帮助透明化、建立合法性/可信度，并明确组织想坚持的价值。
  伦理应该在早期、中期还是后期出现？比较好的做法是：**早期就要出现**，先明确“我们想走向哪里、什么不能做”。后续可以再做更细的评估与审计，但如果一开始价值边界不清，团队很容易把系统优化到一个“社会不接受/难以落地”的方向。

  [18:15–18:17] **Transition to guest lecture**
  **English** Let’s welcome our guest speaker, Mr. Koo Seng Meng (AI Singapore). He has a busy schedule of travel and work, yet he still made time to join us.

  **Chinese** 接下来欢迎我们的嘉宾：AI Singapore 的 Koo Seng Meng 先生。行程很满，但还是抽时间来给我们分享。

  [18:17–18:20] **Guest background + key framing: real-world foresight is messy**
  **English** (Guest) I started with R&D and patents (e.g., early display technologies—many of you may not have seen cathode ray tubes). I moved from R&D into business development and technology portfolio work. In 2012 I joined Singapore’s public service (then under the Infocomm Development Authority).
  Over time I see myself as an “intrapreneur,” launching several first-in-region or first-in-world products across industry (e.g., Sony Ericsson, Siemens, and public sector roles). Today I’m Director of Talent Development at AI Singapore, working on capacity/capability building and shaping the talent ecosystem with government agencies.
  For today, I want to share AI Singapore’s ~8-year journey. In practice, technology forecasting/foresight is not clean-cut—it is messy. Often we understand things in hindsight more clearly than in real time.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）我最早做研发与专利（例如早期显示技术——现在很多同学可能都没见过阴极射线管 CRT）。后来从研发转到业务拓展与技术组合管理。2012 年进入新加坡公共部门（当时在 IDA 体系内）。
  我把自己看作“企业内创业者（intrapreneur）”，曾推动过一些区域首创/全球首创的产品与项目。现在我在 AI Singapore 做人才发展负责人，主要做能力建设、生态建设，并和政府机构一起塑造人才体系。
  今天我想用 AI Singapore 过去大约 8 年的发展过程来讲：现实世界里的预测/前瞻并不“干净”，往往很“混乱”；很多时候我们是事后回看才更清晰。

  [18:20–18:23] **AISG origin: national foresight cycle and phased national strategy**
  **English** (Guest) AI Singapore started in 2017, but the decision to invest in AI was discussed earlier (around 2015) at the national level under Singapore’s research governance structure. The key issue was: AI is a frontier technology, we “don’t know what we don’t know,” so we must invest strategically.
  AI Singapore was set up as a national program office coordinated across multiple government agencies. Early mandate: explore possibilities and “fail fast” if needed. By 2019 we learned what worked and what didn’t, helping shape Singapore’s National AI Strategy (version 1). In 2023 the strategy was updated to 2.0 as AI matured—from “what is AI?” to “what can we do with AI?”
  In the public sector we often behave like “professional crystal-ball users”: we ingest information (patents, industry conversations, signals), filter, analyze, spin up programs, and learn via feedback loops. That is forecasting/foresight at a national scale.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）AI Singapore 在 2017 年成立，但国家层面对 AI 的战略投资讨论更早（大约 2015 年）。核心难点是：AI 属于前沿技术，我们“不知道自己不知道什么”，所以必须更有策略地投。
  AI Singapore 被设为国家级项目办公室，由多个政府机构共同协调。早期使命很明确：探索可能性，必要时快速试错。到 2019 年积累了经验，推动形成国家 AI 战略 1.0；到 2023 年升级为 2.0——因为 AI 更成熟了，重点从“AI 是什么”转到“AI 能做什么”。
  公共部门很多时候像“职业水晶球”：我们尽可能多地收集信息（专利、产业访谈等），筛选分析，启动项目，再通过反馈回路不断调整——这就是国家尺度的 forecasting/foresight。

  [18:23–18:26] **AISG KPIs and “value chain” view of AI**
  **English** (Guest) Early KPIs were simple: publish 100 top AI papers, do 100 industry projects, and run “AI Grand Challenges” in key ministries/sectors (e.g., health, urban solutions, education). Over time, strategies evolve as the technology evolves.
  A useful way to see AISG is a pipeline from research → technology → governance → product innovation → talent development. Another lens is “value capture”: AI is just technology unless you can extract value—economic growth, research excellence, and talent outcomes. So we consider AI value across research, policy/platform, business, and talent pipeline.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）早期 KPI 很直白：顶级论文数量、产业项目数量、以及在关键领域做国家级挑战（比如医疗、城市、教育）。但随着技术发展，战略也必须调整。
  看 AISG 可以用“价值链/管线”的视角：研究 → 技术 → 治理 → 产品创新 → 人才发展。
  也可以用“价值获取”的视角：AI 如果不能带来价值（经济增长、科研能力、人才结果），就只是技术。所以我们把价值分布在研究、政策/平台、产业价值、人才管线等维度去管理。

  [18:26–18:30] **Innovation intermediary + Triple Helix + TRL and “valley of death”**
  **English** (Guest) In research terms, AI Singapore is a **public innovation intermediary**. A classical model here is the **Triple Helix**: government + academia + industry working together. Why? Industry often prefers technology at higher maturity (lower risk). Frontier know-how sits in universities, which is why tech transfer offices exist. Government underwrites experimentation risk, and an intermediary entity helps connect performers (research) with adopters (industry).
  We can think in **Technology Readiness Levels (TRL 1–9)**: early concepts (TRL 1–3), mature everyday products (TRL 7–9), and the hard middle (TRL 4–6) often called the “valley/chasm of death” where many technologies fail to cross into deployable products.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）用学术概念说，AI Singapore 属于**公共创新中介（public innovation intermediary）**。经典框架是 **三螺旋（Triple Helix）**：政府 + 学术 + 产业协同。原因很现实：企业通常更偏好成熟度高、风险小的技术；前沿知识更多在大学，所以需要技术转移；政府的角色是为试验与探索“兜底”，中介组织负责把“技术生产者/研究者”和“技术采用者/企业”连接起来。
  这里也会用 **TRL（技术成熟度等级 1–9）** 来理解：1–3 是概念与原理验证，7–9 是产品化与规模化，中间 4–6 是最难跨越的“死亡之谷”，大量技术就在这里卡住。

  [18:31–18:36] **AI-specific adoption challenge: model is small part; need MLOps + data engineering**
  **English** (Guest) In early AISG industry projects (around 2017), even with professors and researchers involved, outcomes often weren’t usable by companies. Back then, today’s cloud model ecosystems didn’t exist in the same way; many solutions were hard-coded or heavily fine-tuned. Models that looked good in development could break in production because real data differs and drifts.
  We learned AI adoption has specific challenges. Research and media hype often overstate adoption; real adoption and value realization can be much lower. One core reason: training a model is only a small part of an AI project. Real-world systems require integration into a digital platform, with two major capabilities many teams lack: **data engineering** and **MLOps (ML/LLM operations)**—deployment, monitoring, and managing model drift. Companies that succeed at AI often already run large-scale data/platform backends (cloud-scale operations).
  Key “proof point”: if the model never goes into production, no real-world value is created. That forced AISG to pivot: build internal engineering capability to translate research into deployable systems and feed insights back into policy and ecosystem diffusion.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）AISG 早期做产业项目时（2017 前后），即使有教授和研究者参与，结果也经常“不好用/落不了地”。当时的云生态和今天不一样，很多方案是硬编码或重度微调；一旦进入生产环境，真实数据分布不同、会漂移，模型就容易崩。
  我们发现 AI 的采用有“特有难题”。媒体的热度和真实落地往往不一致，真正能产生价值的比例可能很低。关键原因之一是：**训练模型只是很小一部分**。现实系统需要集成到数字平台，还需要很多团队缺乏的能力：**数据工程** + **MLOps/LLMOps**（部署、监控、漂移管理）。能把 AI 做成规模化能力的公司，往往本身就有大型数据平台/云化运营能力。
  一个非常硬的结论是：模型不上生产，就没有价值。所以 AISG 后来必须“转向”：补齐工程化能力，做研究到落地的翻译引擎，同时把一线经验反哺政策与生态扩散。

  [18:37–18:41] **Programs: readiness index + apprenticeship as capacity building**
  **English** (Guest) We shaped the ecosystem by diagnosing which organizations are ready. We built an **AI Readiness Index** (a short questionnaire) to classify organizations: AI-unaware → AI-aware → AI-ready → AI-competent. That helps target limited funding: some firms should first become aware; some should buy off-the-shelf solutions; some are ready for custom projects; and some are already competent and don’t need grants.
  For capacity building, we run the **AI Apprenticeship Programme**: working professionals join for ~9 months, train on real industry projects, and graduate with real deployment experience. Entry includes technical tests similar to major tech hiring styles—because industry evaluates practical ability, not only degrees.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）我们做生态建设时，一个关键动作是“先诊断组织是否准备好”。所以做了 **AI Readiness Index**（短问卷），把组织分成：AI 不认知 → AI 有认知 → AI 准备好 → AI 能胜任。这样才能把有限资金用在刀刃上：有的企业先去“补认知”，有的适合买现成方案，有的适合做定制项目，有的已经很强就不需要再拿补助。
  能力建设方面，有 **AI Apprenticeship Programme**：在职人士参加约 9 个月，用真实产业项目训练，最后带着“真实部署经验”出去。入选要做技术测试，形式接近大厂面试，因为行业更看重现场解决问题能力，而不只是学历。

  [18:41–18:45] **What makes an industry-ready AI engineer + “do AI” vs “do things with AI”**
  **English** (Guest) A strong industry AI engineer isn’t defined only by a computer science background. Many industry problems are domain-heavy (healthcare, aviation, logistics, creative industries). What matters is the ability to understand what data is needed and what “good problem framing” looks like in that domain.
  The labor market increasingly needs people who can *do things with AI*, not only people who can *invent AI algorithms*. We also standardize project delivery with agile approaches and package institutional knowledge into playbooks and tools so others can replicate it.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）行业里“好用的 AI 工程师”不一定只靠纯计算机背景。大量项目是强领域属性的（医疗、航空、物流、创意等），关键能力是：懂业务问题怎么定义、需要什么数据、数据质量风险在哪里。
  现在市场越来越需要“会用 AI 做事的人”，而不仅是“会发明算法的人”。同时我们用敏捷方式标准化交付，并把机构经验沉淀成手册/工具，让生态可以复制。

  [18:45–18:55] **Talent pipeline + GenAI shock + job exposure framing**
  **English** (Guest) Talent development must be intergenerational: we need to influence education one to two generations ahead. We built training hubs and progressively expanded from working professionals to schools, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education.
  After late 2022, generative AI accelerated automation. The key change is not “AI replaces humans” in a simple sense, but that AI-assisted digital automation scales rapidly, disrupting tasks and job scopes. Some analyses (e.g., industry reports and surveys) estimate a significant share of modern job tasks are automatable. A helpful framing is exposure: tasks can be insulated (low exposure), augmented (complementary), or disrupted (high substitution).
  Counterintuitively, some high-cognition creative work may be augmented rather than eliminated—because productivity increases (e.g., faster generation of concept variants), even if the workflow changes.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）人才发展必须看“代际”：至少要提前影响 1–2 代人的教育体系。我们先做成人/在职培训的资源库，再逐步往学校推进，并和教育部门合作。
  2022 年底之后，生成式 AI 让自动化加速。关键不是简单的“AI 取代人”，而是 **AI 辅助的数字自动化规模化**，从而改变任务结构与岗位内容。很多报告用“岗位任务可自动化比例”来描述冲击。
  比较实用的框架是“暴露度”：有的工作几乎不受影响（insulated），有的会被增强（augmented，互补），有的会被强替代（disrupted）。
  有趣的是，一些高认知的创意工作不一定被消灭，反而可能被增强——因为工具让产能上升（比如更快生成多版本概念方案），但工作方式会改变。

  [18:55–19:01] **Institutionalization: playbooks, regional LLM (Sea Lion), standards, and “human element”**
  **English** (Guest) As a public entity, long-term value is to encapsulate institutional knowledge and diffuse it—so we encode practices into handbooks/playbooks (how to start an AI project, what is or isn’t an AI project).
  We also invest in a regional language model initiative (Sea Lion) to better represent ASEAN contexts and reduce risks of cultural misrepresentation when models become dominant information interfaces.
  On “rewarding good actors,” standards matter. Singapore participates in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 (AI standards). Standards form a knowledge map and can support compliance and trust-building across jurisdictions.
  Finally, across all programs, the human element remains central: even if technology has clear advantages, individuals may resist adoption. Change management and mindset shifts are often decisive.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）作为公共机构，长期价值在于把经验“制度化”并扩散出去，所以我们把方法写进手册/工具包（如何启动 AI 项目、什么算 AI 项目、什么不算）。
  我们也投入区域语言模型（Sea Lion），让模型更能覆盖 ASEAN 语境，降低“文化被错误代表”的风险——因为大模型越来越可能成为信息入口。
  对于“奖励守规矩的好参与者”，标准体系很重要。新加坡参与 ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42（AI 标准委员会），标准本身构成一张知识地图，有助于跨地区的合规与信任。
  最后，无论做多少技术项目，“人”的因素都绕不开：技术再好也可能有人抵触使用，所以变革管理与心态迁移往往是成败关键。

  [19:47–19:50] **From guest lecture back to benchmarking: the “luxury to think about the future” problem**
  **English** Let’s come back to a key tension raised in both the guest talk and the benchmarking report. Many firms say: *we are overwhelmed by current problems; we don’t have the luxury to think about the future*.
  This is the million-dollar question: how do you balance today’s survival with future investment? The report highlights that most businesses naturally focus on immediate operational issues and short-term returns, which crowds out foresighting.

  **Chinese** 回到一个在嘉宾分享和 benchmarking 报告中都反复出现的张力：很多企业会说——我们眼前问题已经够多了，根本没有“余力”去想未来。
  这正是“百万美元问题”：如何在**生存压力**和**未来投入**之间取得平衡？报告指出，大多数企业会被短期问题和短期回报牵着走，结果就是 foresighting 被不断挤压。

  [19:48–19:55] **SMEs, limited capability, and the role of intermediaries/government**
  **English** This challenge is especially real for small and medium enterprises. If you’re fighting for bread and butter today, asking you to plan five years ahead feels unrealistic.
  So what should such firms do? One option is to rely on intermediaries and government bodies. That’s precisely why innovation intermediaries exist. When industry is not ready to place bets on discontinuous technologies, the state often steps in early—setting up programs, grants, and shared infrastructure.
  Singapore is often described as being “creature-like” in sensing future threats early. Agencies step in to help SMEs gear up for transitions (for example, emissions-free futures in maritime industries). Firms with capability should juggle short-term and long-term internally; those without should leverage external support.

  **Chinese** 这个问题对中小企业尤其现实：如果今天都在为现金流和生存发愁，让你去想五年、十年后的未来，确实不现实。
  那怎么办？一种可行路径就是**借助中介组织和政府机构**。这正是创新中介存在的意义：当产业还没准备好为“断裂式技术”下注时，国家先行介入，通过项目、补贴、公共平台降低试错成本。
  新加坡常被形容为“提前感知风险”的国家。政府部门会帮助中小企业为转型做准备（比如航运业的减排转型）。有能力的大企业要内部平衡短期与长期；能力不足的中小企业则要善用外部资源。

  [19:55–19:58] **Link to benchmarking report: why profitability and market value**
  **English** This links directly to the benchmarking report. The report uses two outcome variables—**profitability** and **market capitalization**. Why these two?
  Because firms can fail in two opposite ways:

  * Focus only on current profits and lose the future.
  * Focus only on the future and lose current viability.
    The report classifies firms into four types (e.g., vigilant, vulnerable, neurotic, etc.) to show that balance matters. Over-optimizing either side is risky. Incentives and KPIs must reflect this balance.

  **Chinese** 这正好呼应 benchmarking 报告里的核心设计：为什么用 **盈利能力（profitability）** 和 **市值（market capitalization）** 这两个结果变量？
  因为企业可能在两个方向上失败：

  * 只看当下利润，未来被淘汰；
  * 只押未来，眼前先“饿死”。
    报告用四种企业类型（如 vigilant、vulnerable、neurotic 等）来说明：关键在于**平衡**。激励机制和 KPI 设计必须体现这一点。

  [19:58–20:01] **Adoption reality: POCs, employees, and change management**
  **English** A student shared a practical observation: many AI projects stop at proof-of-concept. At management level, expectations are high; at employee level, adoption is low because it adds workload and disrupts routines.
  This is common. Even in universities or public systems, people stop using tools when systems change too frequently. Without investment in **change management**, adoption will stall. Technology foresight without organizational change capability rarely translates into value.

  **Chinese** 有同学分享了很真实的现象：很多 AI 项目卡在 POC 阶段。管理层期待很高，但员工层面的采用率很低，因为工具增加了负担、打乱了原有流程。
  这种情况非常普遍。系统更新太快，人自然会放弃使用。如果企业不投入**变革管理（change management）**，再好的技术也难以落地。没有组织能力支撑的 foresight，很难真正创造价值。

  [20:03–20:06] **Framing the guest lecture as foresight value**
  **English** Bringing it back: the guest lecture answers the question, *how does a nation prepare for future technological disruption?*
  Key takeaways include: using readiness assessments, talent pipelines from school to workforce, and playbooks built from repeated experimentation (e.g., “100 experiments”). These are concrete ways foresight translates into value—not just abstract thinking.

  **Chinese** 回到主题：嘉宾分享本质上回答了一个问题——**国家如何为未来的技术颠覆做准备？**
  关键启示包括：用 readiness 评估工具、从学校到职场的人才管线、以及通过大量实验沉淀成“可复制的 playbook”（例如 100 次实验）。这些都是 foresight 转化为价值的具体机制，而不只是抽象讨论。

  **00:00 - 02:45: Change Management & Government Support for AI**

  **Professor:** Don't invest in change management and they want things to change, it's not going to happen. They should be aware of it. It's a big topic in itself. I'll see if I can cover a little bit of it in knowledge management. We need to move on. You have any pressing question? Yes.

  **Student:** Because he mentioned about the confidence for the small and medium enterprises... they cannot cross the gap to reach to the AI Singapore to reach to the government body or agencies. But because they have like limited resources and financial perspective, so they don't have enough money. So if government charge for them...

  **Professor:** No, no, that's wrong. They will give subsidy to these companies. Depends on the government as well. That's why you should be aware of all these grants. There is one paper totally focusing on all the grants provided by every country, especially for small and medium enterprises across different countries that we will look at.

  **Student:** But the government cannot help all these kind of companies, so some of them...

  **Professor:** They need to be selective, right? That's just like how Seng Meng said. They will see how AI-ready they are. If they are not AI-ready, they will say, "Go equip yourself." If you are a little bit AI-ready, they will try to help handhold you. If you are too ready, they will say, "Bye-bye." You're self-sufficient.

  **Student:** So if by not being selected by the government, then I have to look for agencies? Like if I don't have that much of the money for this kind of...

  **Professor:** You are going to be cannibalized soon. You need to invest at least a little bit for your own future. If you are willing to put in a bit, government will put its portion. You see?

  **Professor:** All right. On that note, let's move on to the lecture itself. Oh my god. Okay. This is the first question for the benchmarking report.

  **教授：** 如果不投资于变革管理却希望事情发生改变，那是不会发生的。他们应该意识到这一点。这本身就是一个很大的话题。我会看看能否在知识管理部分稍微涵盖一点。我们需要继续了。你们有什么紧迫的问题吗？请讲。

  **学生：** 因为他提到中小型企业的信心问题……他们无法跨越鸿沟去接触 AI Singapore（新加坡人工智能计划），或者接触政府机构或部门。但因为他们的资源和财务状况有限，所以没有足够的资金。如果政府向他们收费……

  **教授：** 不，不，那是错的。政府会给这些公司提供补贴。这也取决于政府。所以你应该了解所有这些拨款。有一篇论文完全专注于各国提供的所有拨款，特别是针对不同国家的中小型企业，我们会看看那个。

  **学生：** 但是政府不能帮助所有这类公司，所以其中一些……

  **教授：** 他们需要有选择性，对吧？就像 Seng Meng 说的那样。他们会看这些公司的 AI 就绪程度（AI readiness）。如果还没准备好，他们会说：“去充实自己吧。”如果你有一点准备，他们会试着以此引导你。如果你已经准备得很充分了，他们会说：“再见。”因为你已经可以自给自足了。

  **学生：** 那么如果不被政府选中，我就得去找代理机构吗？如果我没有那么多钱做这种……

  **教授：** 你很快就会被吞并（cannibalized）。你需要为自己的未来至少投资一点点。如果你愿意投入一点，政府也会投入它的那部分。明白吗？

  **教授：** 好了。既然如此，我们继续讲课。天哪。好的。这是关于基准报告的第一个问题。

  **02:45 - 06:10: Introduction to Foresight Benchmarking Report**

  **Professor:** Regarding Seng Meng's thing on the top, right? How nation prepares for future or technological disruptions. How it equips... that's the whole message from this talk. How companies like you can tap into such resources and can tap into things like AI readiness levels, can tap into all those charts that he showed. Those are key valuable lessons for you. And last but not least, the talent. How country develops the talents starting from school till the workforce. They didn't even leave the school; they are preparing them also that you need to be aware of.

  **Professor:** So it's more on foresighting at the national level that he shared, but there are lots of lessons for firms. Especially the most valuable being the AI Playbook. These agencies having done 100 experiments... he didn't elaborate more because this is one project wherein I was closely working with him. Which means the government decided, "I am going to help 100 companies in Singapore implement AI and show the returns." You see? This is where it ties up to today's topic. How foresighting is of value. What is the value of foresighting?

  **Professor:** So he mentioned in the initial days the foresighting was all about KPIs. How many companies you help? How many apprentices you created and all? That was the first two cycle. In the third cycle, that's when I started working with him on another project, it talks about what did AI Singapore achieve for the nation? What economic returns did they bring in? That's where the "100E" experiments were helpful. How much of revenue they created? How much of new products they developed? How many new markets they tapped into? So those are economic returns.

  **Professor:** So at some point, even at the national level, it's not enough if you just look at the earlier KPIs. You should also look at tangible value. And that's what any CEOs would ask you. If you say, "Can I implement foresighting for the company? Can you allocate some budget?" They might give you initially, but after the first two cycles they will ask you, "How did you create value for me, for my company?" And that's where the Foresight Benchmarking Report neatly fits in. It will be asked by bosses, it will be asked by country, it will be asked by industry as well.

  **教授：** 关于 Seng Meng 之前讲的内容，对吧？国家如何为未来或技术颠覆做准备。它是如何装备……这是那场讲座的核心信息。像你们这样的公司如何利用这些资源，如何利用像 AI 就绪水平这样的东西，利用他展示的所有那些图表。这些对你们来说都是非常宝贵的经验。最后但同样重要的是人才。国家如何从学校到职场培养人才。他们甚至还没离开学校，国家就已经在为他们做准备了，这也是你们需要知道的。

  **教授：** 所以他分享的更多是国家层面的前瞻（foresighting），但对企业来说也有很多教训。尤其是最有价值的 AI Playbook（人工智能行动指南）。这些机构做了100个实验……他没有详细说明，因为这是一个我和他密切合作的项目。这意味着政府决定：“我要帮助新加坡的100家公司实施人工智能并展示回报。”你看？这就是它与今天主题的联系所在。前瞻的价值是什么？前瞻有什么价值？

  **教授：** 他提到在早期，前瞻主要关于 KPI（关键绩效指标）。你帮助了多少家公司？你培养了多少学徒等等？那是前两个周期。在第三个周期，也就是我开始和他合作另一个项目的时候，讨论的是 AI Singapore 为国家取得了什么成就？他们带来了什么经济回报？这就是“100E”实验有用的地方。他们创造了多少收入？开发了多少新产品？进入了多少新市场？这些都是经济回报。

  **教授：** 所以在某种程度上，即使在国家层面，仅仅看早期的 KPI 是不够的。你还应该看有形的价值。这也是任何 CEO 会问你的。如果你说：“我可以为公司实施前瞻吗？你能分配一些预算吗？”他们最初可能会给你，但在前两个周期之后，他们会问你：“你为我、为我的公司创造了什么价值？”这就是《前瞻基准报告》（Foresight Benchmarking Report）恰好切入的地方。老板会问，国家会问，行业也会问。

  **06:10 - 08:30: Discussion on Decision Making and Foresight Maturity**

  **Professor:** Okay. Now coming back to the Foresight Benchmarking Report. The first challenge is... thought of doing group work but we don't have time so let's make it individual. As a decision maker, what are the key lessons you imbibe from the article? Which aspects should you give more importance to when you read this article? There are two levels at which I'll ask questions about benchmarking report. One is as a decision maker. The other one is as an intelligence agent. So the first question is as a decision maker, what are the key lessons you take away from? Who wants to give it a shot? Yes, Sahil.

  **Student (Sahil):** So one of the things that was mentioned in the report was about perceiving, prospecting and probing. I feel like as a decision maker, what I inferred from this is that these are continuous processes. So from... we start from perceiving and then that moves on to prospecting and then that moves on to probing. So what I inferred is that the most important...

  **Professor:** Okay. Yeah, go ahead. I'm listening.

  **Student (Sahil):** Yeah, what I inferred is that it all starts at perceiving. That is data collection and analyzing what is happening, what is going to happen and all of that. And then we move on to prospecting and probing. So I feel in perceiving, for example, having all the research work done or like having investments... like for example in what he mentioned about AI Singapore, having the investment... making the investment in order for us to get the perceiving information. I think that is the key starting point that then leads to the next steps in order for us to get the returns of whatever was mentioned in the later half of the document. So I felt the starting point is there and that is the most important and once we knock that first block and then the rest of the blocks can happen.

  **Professor:** Understood. So it's a three piece. Right? That a decision maker should be aware of. Okay, good. That's one of the pieces. What else?

  **教授：** 好的。现在回到《前瞻基准报告》。第一个挑战是……本来想做小组作业，但我们没有时间，所以就个人完成吧。作为一个决策者，你从文章中吸取了哪些关键教训？在阅读这篇文章时，你应该更重视哪些方面？我会从两个层面问关于基准报告的问题。一个是作为决策者。另一个是作为情报人员（intelligence agent）。那么第一个问题是，作为决策者，你带走了哪些关键教训？谁想试一试？是的，Sahil。

  **学生 (Sahil)：** 报告中提到的一点是关于感知（perceiving）、展望（prospecting）和探索（probing）。我觉得作为决策者，我从中推断出这些是持续的过程。所以从……我们从感知开始，然后进入展望，再进入探索。所以我推断最重要的是……

  **教授：** 好的。请继续，我在听。

  **学生 (Sahil)：** 是的，我推断一切都始于感知。即数据收集和分析正在发生什么、将要发生什么等等。然后我们进入展望和探索。所以我感觉在感知阶段，例如完成所有的研究工作或者进行投资……比如他提到的关于 AI Singapore 的内容，进行投资……为了让我们获得感知信息而进行投资。我认为这是一个关键的起点，然后通过它进入后续步骤，以便我们获得文档后半部分提到的那些回报。所以我感觉起点在那里，那是最重要的，一旦我们要敲开了第一块砖，剩下的部分就会顺理成章地发生。

  **教授：** 明白了。所以它是三个“P”（Three Ps）。对吧？决策者应该意识到的。好的，很好。这是其中一部分。还有什么？

  **08:30 - 10:00: Evaluating Foresight Readiness vs. Performance**

  **Student:** Uh, as a decision maker, I think... I'm aware that there is a measurement that can give me advice what my organization or my company is standing on. Whether the foresighting for my company is enough or not. Which brings... which brings my company is dangerous in the future or is safe. So...

  **Professor:** Foresight maturity... gauging. Okay, good. What else?

  **Student:** So as a decision maker, I believe what my decision is is to whether I should invest money in this or not. So what I should do or what I think is important is to see if the foresight maturity match the foresight needs. And then after that I categorize whether the company is at what stage before I make the decision of whether I should invest money.

  **Professor:** Yeah. So very good. Before I decide on whether I want to invest on foresighting itself, what is the need for my industry? Is it even needed? So that I don't become neurotic. Right? Yeah. What else?

  **Student:** So in order to do that, I think as a decision maker, one would definitely know how the company perform. So this measuring the firm performance would be one important criteria to know. So that then you will come to know whether you need the foresighting. So it's more of the firm performance.

  **Professor:** That cannot be the right gauge. So when you say performance what will you look at?

  **Student:** You look at the company performance, also your competitor, the data and things like that.

  **Professor:** But what if they are doing well today? So can they be satisfied about it? That's where the problem lies. I am good today but am I prepared for future? It's a question mark.

  **Student:** But if we don't know where are we performing today, then how do we...

  **Professor:** It's a hygiene factor. I don't deny it. Of course any boss will do that. Am I performing well or not? But you shouldn't use that as a metric to decide whether is my foresighting enough or not. That's what I mean. Of course we should be aware of performance. We should gauge it. We should know where they are standing with respect to competitors. But that, while that is hygiene factor, that cannot determine whether they should invest in futuristic vision or not. These two can be very different. That's why I said there are two things. When you look at performance, if you are looking at only profitability, that cannot be the right gauge. That's the whole crux of the article. You need to look at future potential of the company. That's where the market capitalization comes in picture. Let's take there and come here.

  **学生：** 呃，作为决策者，我想……我知道有一种衡量标准可以给我建议，告诉我我的组织或公司处于什么位置。我公司的前瞻工作是否足够。这会带来……这表明我的公司在未来是处于危险之中还是安全的。所以……

  **教授：** 前瞻成熟度（Foresight maturity）……评估。好的，很好。还有什么？

  **学生：** 作为一个决策者，我认为我的决定在于是否应该在这方面投资。所以我应该做的，或者我认为重要的是，看看前瞻成熟度是否与前瞻需求相匹配。然后在决定是否应该投资之前，我会对公司处于什么阶段进行分类。

  **教授：** 是的。非常好。在我决定是否要投资于前瞻本身之前，我的行业对此有什么需求？是否真的需要？这样我就不会变得“神经质”（neurotic）。对吧？是的。还有什么？

  **学生：** 为了做到这一点，我认为作为决策者，必须知道公司的表现如何。所以衡量公司绩效是一个重要的标准。这样你就会知道是否需要前瞻。所以更多的是关于公司绩效。

  **教授：** 那不能作为正确的衡量标准。当你提到绩效时，你会看什么？

  **学生：** 你看公司绩效，也看你的竞争对手，数据之类的。

  **教授：** 但如果他们今天做得很好呢？他们能对此感到满足吗？问题就在这里。我今天很好，但我为未来做好准备了吗？这是一个问号。

  **学生：** 但是如果我们不知道今天的表现如何，那我们要怎么……

  **教授：** 这是一个保健因素（hygiene factor）。我不否认。当然任何老板都会这样做。我表现得好不好？但你不应该用它作为一个指标来决定我的前瞻工作是否足够。这就是我的意思。当然我们应该了解绩效。我们应该评估它。我们应该知道相对于竞争对手他们的位置。但是，虽然那是保健因素，那不能决定他们是否应该投资于未来的愿景。这两者可能非常不同。所以我说有两件事。当你看绩效时，如果你只看盈利能力，那不能作为正确的衡量标准。这是文章的核心关键。你需要看公司的未来潜力。这就是市值（market capitalization）发挥作用的地方。我们从那里接着讲。

  Here is the transcript and translation for **Part [2]** of the audio file.

  ### **10:00 - 12:40: The Trap of Past Success & Crisis Management**

  **Professor:** Is that clear? Convincing to you?

  **Student (Male):** Yeah, yeah. I mean...

  **Professor:** Yeah. It's important. It's a hygiene factor. They need to take note of. If they don't even meet today, then they can't do anything. But that alone is not enough. Yes, Nisha.

  **Student (Nisha):** Yes, Nisha. I think one of the points going from his point is that it's quite deceiving for companies because financial statements or financial performance is very backward looking. You only do at the end of the month. And then one of the things the article mentioned was that by the time all these threats like creep up on you, and with not enough foresight, these threats were essentially invisible. And then once it happens to you, I think it goes back to your question in the beginning... crisis management. It becomes crisis management instead of foresighting.

  **Professor:** Yes. This is the most important thing of the article itself. When they look at only today's performance, they always, you know, become myopic. They get caught in the past. And the past can sometimes become a trap. That's one of the important lessons from here. Past is good, it led to what it is today, but while it defines the power zone, it can also sometimes become the trap. That's why the future... in [Carlson's] article, power zone is important, but you also look at the future and see if some of the power zones should be killed.

  **教授：** 清楚吗？这一通过说服力吗？

  **学生（男）：** 是的，是的。我是说……

  **教授：** 是的。这很重要。这是一个保健因素。他们需要注意。如果他们连今天的要求都达不到，那就什么也做不了。但仅靠这一点是不够的。请讲，Nisha。

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 是的，我是 Nisha。我认为从他的观点延伸出来的一点是，这对公司来说非常有欺骗性，因为财务报表或财务绩效是非常向后看的（滞后的）。你只在月底才做。文章提到的一点是，当所有这些威胁悄悄逼近你时，如果没有足够的前瞻性，这些威胁本质上是隐形的。一旦它发生在你身上，我认为这回到了你开头提出的问题……危机管理。它变成了危机管理，而不是前瞻。

  **教授：** 是的。这是这篇文章本身最重要的一点。当他们只关注今天的表现时，他们总是，你知道，变得目光短浅。他们被过去所困。过去有时会成为陷阱。这是这里最重要的教训之一。过去是好的，它造就了今天的局面，但虽然它定义了“力量区”（power zone），有时也会成为陷阱。这就是为什么未来……在 [Carlson] 的文章中，力量区很重要，但你也得看看未来，看看是否有些力量区应该被砍掉。

  **12:40 - 15:15: Killing Projects & The Four Quadrants**

  **Professor:** Right? I do research in one of... one of the important portions of my research which got recognized was about killing projects. Many firms do not kill projects. If you kill projects, that's going to save a lot of thing for your future as well. Right? If some power zones need to be killed, you need to kill. What needs to be enhanced, added, that needs to be done as well. You get what I mean? What you're saying is important, but don't become obsessed with the current. Then it becomes a trap. That's one of the key lessons. Thanks for pointing that. Yeah.

  **Student:** As a decision maker specifically, what jumps out is how do you develop the incentives, like you mentioned, but also the culture for rewarding the type of thinking that facilitates forecasting. Specifically like is there a fear of like cannibalizing existing business models, like you're saying now, or looking at organizational, like very siloed thinking. How do you reward the opposite of that is what I would focus on from that article.

  **Professor:** Okay, so rewarding futuristic thinking, right? And I guess developing that culture... culture and... okay. Because that is one of the... but I'll come to that later. It's going into the details, but it's important for a leader to think about... Sorry. Yeah, I'll take you now.

  **Student:** Yeah, so the article also mentioned focusing competing with existing competitor and neglect to explore future market. So I think...

  **Professor:** Find a point. Yeah.

  **Student:** Another point is very the managers are focusing on existing selves instead of the future opportunity.

  **Professor:** Yeah. That was covered as well. Yeah. So...

  **Student:** Anything else? As a decision maker, I think he need to, he or she need to evaluate how the maturity of the foresight is in five dimensions including information usage, sophistication of method and people networks, organization and also culture.

  **Professor:** This is where it's kind of overlapping between a decision maker and an intelligence agent. Yes, as a decision maker you need to be aware that culture, infrastructure, information, search and scope, all plays a role... only to that extent. Okay? And it's the role of the intelligence analyst to dig deeper. We'll come to that. But it's important. They should be aware. Yes. Yes, God[win]?

  **Student (Godwin):** Yeah, one thing also as a decision maker, I think it's important that we actually have the right operating environment so that such that you actually have in place the correct methodology of collecting the data as well as the right people who can do the analysis work as well as the future planning.

  **Professor:** Having an overarching structure. Okay. Good.

  **Professor:** And there is one more thing that we discussed which a decision maker should be aware of, that there can be four quadrants, right? Neurotic, Vigilant, In danger, Vulnerable. The four quadrants. They should be aware of it. And aware of it with the corresponding performance. How they go up in terms of performance or go down in terms of profitability and market capitalization. Okay?

  **教授：** 对吧？我做的一项研究……我的一项获得认可的重要研究部分是关于“砍掉项目”的。许多公司不砍项目。如果你砍掉项目，那也会为你的未来节省很多资源。对吧？如果某些力量区需要被砍掉，你就得砍。什么需要加强、增加，那也是需要做的。你明白我的意思吗？你所说的是重要的，但不要过度沉迷于现状。那样它就会变成陷阱。这是一个关键教训。谢谢指出这一点。是的。

  **学生：** 特别是作为决策者，跳出来的问题是如何制定激励机制，就像你提到的，还有如何培养奖励那种促进预测思维的文化。特别是是否存在对吞噬现有商业模式的恐惧，就像你现在说的，或者是组织上的非常孤立的思维。如何奖励相反的行为，这是我会从那篇文章中关注的。

  **教授：** 好的，所以奖励未来主义思维，对吧？我想还有培养那种文化……文化和……好的。因为那是其中一个……但我稍后再谈那个。这涉及到了细节，但对于领导者来说，思考这些很重要……抱歉。是的，我现在听你讲。

  **学生：** 是的，所以文章还提到专注于与现有竞争对手竞争，而忽视了探索未来市场。所以我认为……

  **教授：** 这是一个观点。是的。

  **学生：** 另一点是经理们非常专注于现有的自我（现状），而不是未来的机会。

  **教授：** 是的。那也涵盖了。是的。那么……

  **学生：** 还有其他的吗？作为决策者，我认为他需要，他或她需要评估前瞻的成熟度在五个维度上的表现，包括信息使用、方法的复杂性、人员网络、组织以及文化。

  **教授：** 这就是决策者和情报人员之间有点重叠的地方。是的，作为决策者，你需要意识到文化、基础设施、信息、搜索和范围，所有这些都发挥作用……但也仅限于此。好吗？深入挖掘是情报分析师的职责。我们会谈到那个。但这很重要。他们应该意识到。是的。是的，God[win]？

  **学生 (Godwin)：** 是的，作为决策者还有一件事，我认为重要的是我们实际上要有正确的运营环境，这样你实际上已经有了收集数据的正确方法，以及可以做分析工作和未来规划的合适人选。

  **教授：** 拥有一个总体结构。好的。很好。

  **教授：** 还有一件事我们也讨论过，决策者应该意识到的，那就是可能有四个象限，对吧？神经质（Neurotic）、警惕（Vigilant）、处于危险（In danger）、脆弱（Vulnerable）。这四个象限。他们应该意识到这一点。并且要意识到与之对应的绩效。它们在绩效方面如何上升，或者在盈利能力和市值方面如何下降。好吗？

  **15:15 - 18:00: Analyst Perspective: The 7-Year Time Lag**

  **Professor:** As a decision maker, you need to be aware that yes, foresighting is valuable. Because it generates current profit, it ensures bright future. That you need to be aware of. Second, that you need to be aware of in foresighting doesn't mean you become so engrossed in it. You need to understand that you should do foresighting only to the extent that your industry, your company, wherever you are in your situation, demands. Don't overdo it. It's an overkill. Okay? And don't underdo it as well. That they need to be aware of.

  **Professor:** And to do it, what are the steps you need to take? The 3 Ps. Right? What are the 3 Ps?

  **Class:** Perceiving, Prospecting, Probing.

  **Professor:** Perceiving, Prospecting and Probing. Now I don't want to go into that details, that much details like what you said, because that will be the job of the analyst. They need to be aware of these three things at the higher level. What is perceiving?

  **Professor:** And telling all this because at some point if you were to do foresighting or intelligence, you should pitch your slide to the respective audience. For decision makers these are the things you need to focus on. And same thing for your outputs as well. I told you last week that when you give your deliverables, make it focused to the audience. So you should know for decision makers you need to pitch at this level. Right? Don't give too many details that they don't like. Okay, these are the things.

  **Professor:** For perceiving we have what is called Technology Radar. For prospect we have what is called Scenario Planning. And for probing we have CVCs and listening posts and everything. Right?

  **Professor:** Now the question boils down to: as an analyst, what all aspects in the paper that you should care about? Now as an analyst, you need to care about... Do you have to think about the higher level or you get into the details? The devil is in the details for you as an analyst. So what all details will you do you gather from the article? Yes, [Li Jia]?

  **Student (Li Jia):** Time lag between the foresight activity and the performance outcome.

  **Professor:** Spot on. That's the most important thing. Why... and that's also the first question in my template. What is the purpose of the article? It is to show the value of foresighting. So, do you think you invest in foresighting today and can you look for returns tomorrow? That's bullshit. You can't do. Right? Even for AI Singapore, they gave like three cycles to show their value. So when you invest in foresighting, if you ask for budget from your boss, in two years he is asking for value, you should know what kind of value to show.

  **教授：** 作为决策者，你需要意识到，是的，前瞻是有价值的。因为它产生当前利润，它确保光明的未来。这你需要意识到。第二，你在前瞻中需要意识到，并不意味着你要完全沉迷其中。你需要明白，你应该只做到你的行业、你的公司、你所处的情况所要求的程度。不要做过头。那是画蛇添足（overkill）。好吗？也不要做得不够。这也是他们需要意识到的。

  **教授：** 要做到这一点，你需要采取哪些步骤？三个“P”。对吧？哪三个“P”？

  **全班：** 感知（Perceiving）、展望（Prospecting）、探索（Probing）。

  **教授：** 感知、展望和探索。现在我不想进入那么详细的细节，像你刚才说的那样详细，因为那将是分析师的工作。他们需要在更高层面上意识到这三件事。什么是感知？

  **教授：** 讲这些是因为在某个时候，如果你要做前瞻或情报工作，你应该向相应的受众推销你的幻灯片。对于决策者来说，这些是你需要关注的事情。对于你的产出也是一样。我上周告诉过你们，当你提交交付成果时，要针对受众。所以你应该知道对于决策者，你需要在这个层面上进行推销。对吧？不要给出太多他们不喜欢的细节。好的，就是这些。

  **教授：** 对于感知，我们有所谓的“技术雷达”（Technology Radar）。对于展望，我们有“情景规划”（Scenario Planning）。对于探索，我们有企业风险投资（CVCs）和监听站（listening posts）等等。对吧？

  **教授：** 现在问题归结为：作为一名分析师，你应该关心论文中的哪些方面？现在作为一名分析师，你需要关心……你是要考虑更高层面还是进入细节？对于作为分析师的你来说，魔鬼就在细节中。那么你会从文章中收集哪些细节呢？是的，[Li Jia]？

  **学生 (Li Jia)：** 前瞻活动和绩效结果之间的时间滞后（Time lag）。

  **教授：** 完全正确。那是最重要的事情。为什么……这也是我模板中的第一个问题。文章的目的是什么？是为了展示前瞻的价值。所以，你认为你今天投资前瞻，明天就能看到回报吗？那是胡扯。你做不到。对吧？即使对于 AI Singapore，他们也给了大概三个周期来展示他们的价值。所以当你投资前瞻时，如果你向老板申请预算，两年后他问你要价值，你应该知道要展示什么样的价值。

  **20:00 - 22:30: The Value of Foresight & Managing Expectations**

  **Professor:** If it is 4 years, 6 years down the line, 8 years down the line, if you're still not showing economic value, you are doomed. You'll be out of job. Right?

  **Professor:** So you you should know the time frame. That's why I said when it comes to foresighting the time makes a big difference. As an intelligence analyst you should know how long should I look for... how long should I collect the data.

  **Professor:** Okay? So it took what? 7, 6, 7 years?

  **Class:** Yeah.

  **Professor:** Yeah. From the time till he showed the value. This was the problem. René is who wrote this benchmarking report, he will give you a guest lecture one of the weeks. Okay? He's from France. His group did the study because until then people thought foresighting has no tangible value. Until he spent seven years to do this benchmarking report to show indeed it is valuable to firms. Okay? This is what you need to do. Yeah? Good? Seven years it takes? Yes.

  **Student:** The data accuracy, data confidence or sampling... I need to take off...

  **Professor:** Good. Sampling that you need to think of. Sometimes you go with convenience sampling also. René was at some point, he wanted to do foresighting maturity for the whole world. He asked me to do for Singapore but I didn't have the bandwidth to do for Singapore. You see? So sometimes convenience sampling also works but it needs to be representative. The sample makes a difference. Yes. What else?

  **Student (Nisha):** Isolating like the different business factors from impact of foresight.

  **Professor:** That's the second most important thing in the article. When I presented my... my project which I'll talk about tomorrow, I was presenting to all the executives of A*STAR and EDB is the one which funded it. It was under NRF. So the first thing they asked is: So how can you ensure that the value is not confounded by many factors? It is the foresighting which is creating the value. How can you ensure that? Sometimes people say it could be luck. Right? COVID hit and these industries pumped up. These industries doomed. It's mere luck.

  **Professor:** No, if you were looking for weak signals, you could be ready even for COVID. Right? That's what many companies which managed to be agile to pick up, they survived as well. Right? So the second most important thing in the project, in the paper is that how do you separate the cause and effect from noise? And how did they do it?

  **教授：** 如果那是四年、六年、八年之后，如果你还没有展示出经济价值，你就完了。你会失业的。对吧？

  **教授：** 所以你，你应该知道时间框架。这就是为什么我说，当涉及到前瞻时，时间会有很大不同。作为一名情报分析师，你应该知道我应该观察多长时间……我应该收集多长时间的数据。

  **教授：** 好的？所以这花了多久？7、6、7年？

  **全班：** 是的。

  **教授：** 是的。从那个时候直到他展示价值。这就是问题所在。写这份基准报告的是 René，他将在其中几周给你们做一个客座讲座。好吗？他来自法国。他的小组做了这项研究，因为在那之前人们认为前瞻没有有形价值。直到他花了七年时间做这份基准报告，证明了它对公司确实有价值。好吗？这就是你们需要做的。是吗？好的？花了七年？是的。

  **学生：** 数据准确性、数据置信度或抽样……我需要去掉……

  **教授：** 很好。抽样是你需要考虑的。有时你也会使用便利抽样（convenience sampling）。René 曾经一度想做全世界的前瞻成熟度调查。他让我做新加坡的，但我没有精力做新加坡的。你看？所以有时便利抽样也是可行的，但它需要具有代表性。样本会有所不同。是的。还有什么？

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 将不同的商业因素与前瞻的影响隔离开来。

  **教授：** 那是文章中第二重要的事情。当我展示我的……我的项目（我明天会讲到）时，我是向 A*STAR（新加坡科技研究局）的所有高管展示，EDB（新加坡经济发展局）是资助方。它属于 NRF（新加坡国立研究基金会）。所以他们问的第一件事是：既然如此，你如何确保价值不被许多因素混淆？创造价值的是前瞻。你如何确保这一点？有时人们说这可能是运气。对吧？新冠疫情爆发，这些行业暴涨。那些行业完蛋。这纯粹是运气。

  **教授：** 不，如果你在寻找微弱信号，你甚至可以为新冠疫情做好准备。对吧？这就是许多设法变得敏捷并捕捉到信号的公司幸存下来的原因。对吧？所以项目中，或者说论文中第二重要的事情是，你如何从噪音中分离出因果关系？他们是怎么做到的？

  **22:30 - 25:00: Avoiding Confounding Factors & Industry Clustering**

  **Professor:** How did they manage to do? As an analyst if you can't do it, you're failed already. At least in this paper that's the simplest that they can do which they did. [Chang Wom] does even more sophisticated cause and effect models, I know. Anyone? How did they manage to do? As an analyst if you can't do it, you're failed already.

  **Student:** Anyone?

  **Student:** Their future preparedness concepts to use the maturity consistently and the...

  **Professor:** Exactly. Because different industries needs different foresighting requirements and the maturity can be different. So they came up with this clustering: What is the maturity level of companies? What is the need required? Whether they are in par or whether they are neurotic or they are in danger or, you know, all those vulnerable situations. And then they assess the performance. Maturity compared to the performance. And then they said, "Yeah, future ready firms are indeed performing better."

  **Professor:** If you were to categorize and clu... Did everyone get the point? The clustering like this helped in they avoiding confounding factors from affecting the result. That's the simplest that they did. Is that clear? Or no?

  **Class:** No.

  **Student:** How to...

  **Professor:** Usually they'll do the experiment like control one...

  **Professor:** Control and experimental sample is what they would do. That's what I did in my research next week which I'll show. But in this case, because they were collecting data in the past, you know, they were looking at future ready and then future, what they did is even if you were to do, right, control and experimental, what if it's confounded by different firms from different industries? Which happened in my case.

  **Professor:** So what they did is they looked at companies from different industries. Okay? They grouped them. And then they look at for this industry, what is the foresighting need? Okay? For... it will be different for different industries. And for each firms in each of those industries, they classify the firms maturity, foresighting maturity level. And then they classify the firms into four different types. So that will be done across different industries. Okay?

  **Professor:** So now they look at performance. Whether they perform... the those in foresight ready are doing well or not. And then they do an average across different industries. It is not fool proof but that's the first step towards avoiding confounding factors. You get what I mean?

  **教授：** 他们是如何做到的？作为一名分析师，如果你做不到这一点，你就已经失败了。至少在这篇论文中，这是他们能做的最简单的方法，他们也做到了。[Chang Wom] 做了更复杂的因果模型，我知道。有人知道吗？他们是怎么做到的？作为一名分析师，如果你做不到这一点，你就已经失败了。

  **学生：** 有人吗？

  **学生：** 他们的未来准备度（future preparedness）概念，即一致地使用成熟度和……

  **教授：** 确实如此。因为不同的行业需要不同的前瞻要求，成熟度也会不同。所以他们提出了这种聚类（clustering）：公司的成熟度水平是多少？所需的需求是什么？它们是持平的，还是神经质的，或者是处于危险之中，或者你知道，所有那些脆弱的情况。然后他们评估绩效。将成熟度与绩效进行比较。然后他们说：“是的，为未来做好准备的公司确实表现得更好。”

  **教授：** 如果你要分类和聚……大家都明白了吗？像这样的聚类有助于避免混淆因素影响结果。那是他们做的最简单的事情。清楚了吗？还是不清楚？

  **全班：** 不清楚。

  **学生：** 怎么……

  **教授：** 通常他们会做像控制组那样的实验……

  **教授：** 控制样本和实验样本是他们通常会做的。这正是我下周要在我的研究中展示的。但在这个案例中，因为他们是在收集过去的数据，你知道，他们在看为未来做好的准备以及之后的未来，他们做的是，即使你要做控制组和实验组，如果结果被来自不同行业的不同公司混淆了怎么办？这在我的案例中发生过。

  **教授：** 所以他们做的是，他们观察了来自不同行业的公司。好吗？他们将它们分组。然后他们看对于这个行业，前瞻需求是什么？好吗？对于……不同行业会有所不同。对于这些行业中的每一家公司，他们对公司的成熟度、前瞻成熟度水平进行分类。然后他们将公司分为四种不同类型。所以这将在不同行业之间进行。好吗？

  **教授：** 那么现在他们看绩效。他们是否表现……那些做好前瞻准备的是否表现良好。然后他们在不同行业之间取平均值。这不是万无一失的（fool proof），但这确实是避免混淆因素的第一步。你明白我的意思吗？

  **22:30 - 27:00: Deep Dive into Analyst Metrics**

  **Professor:** Okay. What else as an analyst?

  **Student (Nisha):** What kinds of index should I put into the measurement? And what is the data source? Because the normal financial index... the statement, financial statement balance sheet will not work. So what kind of data should... are we looking for?

  **Professor:** Yeah. So does anyone have an answer? I don't want to show this but there is one thing in the thing about the maturity. You know how maturity was assessed. Right?

  **Class:** Information, methods...

  **Professor:** Information, methods, people and networks, organization and culture. Five aspects, right? And each one of those have different items as well. Whether you like it or not, as an analyst, you might want to give importance to such things. Because that's what you learned from AI SG as well. Maturity level, what are the different indexes you need to do. If your company... for example if you're consulting for [Nisha], her case is very interesting. Had she known about AI readiness index and had she done that for a client, her company need not lose face. Right?

  **Student (Nisha):** Yeah.

  **Professor:** And had she known that index, had she done that for the client. Right? The awareness is very important. There is this index which you can do. Likewise here to assess the foresight maturity there are five different indexes. What about the foresighting need?

  **Professor:** This is a star-star question [Chang Wom]. Foresighting need. Yes.

  **Student:** The [M.L.C.F] and [M.L.C.F]?

  **Professor:** Yeah. What are the items in the foresighting need?

  **Student (Nisha):** Environmental complexity and environmental volatility.

  **Professor:** What are they?

  **Student (Nisha):** Like the... how complicated or your industry or the business environment you are...

  **Professor:** Understand. But did anyone bother to go and get the index items for it? Did anyone? Can anyone tell what that complexity is? Volatility is? The items used?

  **Student:** Uh, complexity is how the surrounding affects the...

  **Professor:** True. But what are the items used to gauge your company... to your industry?

  **Professor:** So this is why as an analyst when you read report, you need to get to the details. They refer to another paper. You need to go and dig deeper to understand what are the items if you were to do the same for your company. So as I told you as intelligence analyst, sometimes you need to dig, dig, dig, dig. Devil is in the details for you. Whether you like it or not. But the devil is not in the details for the decision maker. They need to get the bigger picture right. And they need to understand what it is, not get the details right. Okay? So when you look at references try to go deeper. That's part of being an intelligence analyst. Okay? So these are the different scales used by this paper. What René did is they didn't use all these items, they picked the most important from this and they used. Because they used 15 items or something that's what is mentioned in the paper. Okay? So you need to get into the details. What else?

  **Professor:** So this is what is the five dimensions of maturity. And there are... you know... there is more detail into it which we'll talk about in the last week of the lecture because this determines the maturity level. We do what is called as Foresighting Audit wherein we'll talk the details of it. But I'm not covering it today. All right? So and then you talk about the needs based on these items. Anything else that you need to be aware of of as tech... intelligence agents? There's one more thing. I told you that the 3 Ps. The decision maker is enough for him to know what the 3 Ps are. But the analyst should know the details of it.

  **教授：** 好的。作为一名分析师，还有什么？

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 我应该把什么样的指数放入衡量标准中？数据源是什么？因为普通的财务指数……报表、资产负债表行不通。那么我们应该寻找什么样的数据？

  **教授：** 是的。所以有人有答案吗？我不想展示这个，但是在关于成熟度的事情中有一件事。你知道成熟度是如何评估的。对吧？

  **全班：** 信息、方法……

  **教授：** 信息、方法、人员和网络、组织和文化。五个方面，对吧？每一个都有不同的项目。无论你喜不喜欢，作为一名分析师，你可能要重视这些东西。因为这也是你从 AI SG 那里学到的。成熟度水平，你需要做什么不同的指数。如果你的公司……例如，如果你在为 [Nisha] 咨询，她的案例非常有趣。如果她知道 AI 就绪指数并为客户做了那个，她的公司就不必丢脸了。对吧？

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 是的。

  **教授：** 如果她知道那个指数，如果她为客户做了那个。对吧？这种意识非常重要。有这个指数你可以做。同样在这里，为了评估前瞻成熟度，有五个不同的指数。那么前瞻需求呢？

  **教授：** 这是一个星级问题 [Chang Wom]。前瞻需求。是的。

  **学生：** [M.L.C.F] 和 [M.L.C.F]？

  **教授：** 是的。前瞻需求中的项目是什么？

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 环境复杂性和环境波动性。

  **教授：** 它们是什么？

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 就像……你的行业或商业环境有多复杂……

  **教授：** 明白了。但是有人费心去获取它的指数项目吗？有人吗？谁能告诉我那个复杂性是什么？波动性是什么？使用的项目是什么？

  **学生：** 呃，复杂性是周围环境如何影响……

  **教授：** 没错。但是用来评估你的公司……你的行业的项目是什么？

  **教授：** 这就是为什么作为一名分析师，当你阅读报告时，你需要深入细节。他们参考了另一篇论文。如果要在你的公司做同样的事情，你需要去深入挖掘以了解这些项目是什么。就像我告诉你的，作为情报分析师，有时你需要挖掘、挖掘、挖掘、挖掘。魔鬼就在细节中。无论你喜不喜欢。但对于决策者来说，魔鬼不在细节中。他们需要把握大局。他们需要理解它是什么，而不是纠结细节。好吗？所以当你看参考文献时，试着深入一点。这是作为情报分析师的一部分。好吗？所以这些是这篇论文使用的不同量表。René 做的是，他们没有使用所有这些项目，他们从中挑选了最重要的并使用了。因为他们使用了15个项目左右，这就是论文中提到的。好吗？所以你需要进入细节。还有什么？

  **教授：** 这就是成熟度的五个维度。而且还有……你知道……这其中有更多的细节，我们将在讲座的最后一周讨论，因为这决定了成熟度水平。我们会做所谓的“前瞻审计”（Foresighting Audit），我们会讨论其中的细节。但我今天不讲这部分。好吗？所以然后你会根据这些项目讨论需求。作为技术……情报人员，还有什么你需要意识到的吗？还有一件事。我告诉过你三个“P”。对于决策者来说，知道三个“P”是什么就足够了。但分析师应该知道其中的细节。

  **30:00 - 32:45: The 3 Ps of Foresight: Perceiving, Prospecting, and Probing**

  **Student:** Do you think [inaudible] concept... it's very hard to measure the force of one... like, it is always an intangible kind of concept. So, it's very hard to use a single factor to measure the result...

  **Professor:** You can, as an analyst, you... yeah, you need to be aware of different ways of measuring it, definitely. You should be aware of it. But that's not what I am talking about. What I am talking about is the 3 Ps that he was detailing. One is scanning the environment. That's very easy, right? You have people, you have repositories. Knowledge management is a very important aspect of technology intelligence because many times employees from different parts of the world, they scan, they put in the information which will be analyzed later as well.

  But when it comes to perceiving, we have what is called Technology Radar. For prospecting, we have Scenario Planning. For probing, we have what is called the CVC investments. Probing is very easy. CVC investment is what? You have money, you invest in a small company that's trying to come up with new products, POCs, and ideas. And then you wait and see whether the company is doing well in terms of their ideas, and then later acquire them and bring the technology in-house. That is CVC. How many of you have done this course, CVC investment, in our department, taught by VU? There is a course offered if you want. Corporate Venture Capital Investment course.

  Then Scenario Planning, I'll talk about in one of the weeks. But did anyone bother to know... when you come across these terms, did anyone bother to know Scenario Planning in the past? Scenario Analysis?

  **Student:** In finance.

  **Professor:** In finance.

  **Student:** In IT.

  **Professor:** In IT. It's one and the same, right? Different context. Okay, we'll talk about it. But what is Radar? Did anyone see that nice chart and care to know what it is?

  **Student:** Maybe I am biased, but I looked at the type of innovation just because of the past module and then tried to make sense of it from what I already knew from that. Because I saw like, immediately I saw incremental and like technological recombination. But then relating it now, how does that relate to how it will affect the type of forecasting we do was pretty interesting. Because what if you are a radical innovation? How does that change your strategy then? Because obviously you don't want them to encroach on your type of innovation. But then does that differentiate you from incremental and...

  **Chinese Translation**

  **学生：** 您是否认为……[听不清] 概念……很难去衡量某种力量……就像，这总是一种无形的概念。所以，很难用单一因素来衡量结果……

  **教授：** 作为一名分析师，你可以……是的，你确实需要了解衡量它的不同方法，这毫无疑问。你应该了解这一点。但这并不是我现在要谈论的。我谈论的是他刚才详细阐述的“3P”。一个是扫描环境。这很容易，对吧？你有人员，你有知识库。知识管理是技术情报的一个非常重要的方面，因为很多时候，来自世界各地的员工会进行扫描，并输入信息，这些信息稍后会被分析。

  但谈到“感知（Perceiving）”，我们有所谓的“技术雷达（Technology Radar）”。对于“展望（Prospecting）”，我们有“情景规划（Scenario Planning）”。对于“探索（Probing）”，我们有所谓的“企业风险投资（CVC Investments）”。探索很容易理解。企业风险投资是什么？你有资金，你投资一家试图推出新产品、概念验证（POC）和想法的小公司。然后你通过观察等待，看这家公司在想法方面是否表现良好，随后收购它们并将技术引入内部。这就是 CVC。你们中有多少人在我们系修过这门由 VU 教授的 CVC 投资课程？如果你们想学，有这就叫企业风险投资课程。

  至于情景规划，我会在其中一周讲到。但是有人费心去了解过吗……当你们遇到这些术语时，以前有人去了解过情景规划吗？情景分析？

  **学生：** 在金融领域。

  **教授：** 在金融领域。

  **学生：** 在 IT 领域。

  **教授：** 在 IT 领域。其实是一样的，对吧？只是背景不同。好的，我们会谈论它。但是什么是雷达？有人看过那个漂亮的图表并想知道它是什么吗？

  **学生：** 也许我有偏见，但我关注的是创新类型，仅仅是因为过去的模块，然后试图根据我从中已知的知识来理解它。因为我看到……我立刻看到了渐进式创新和技术重组。但现在将其联系起来，它如何关系到它将如何影响我们要做的预测类型，这非常有趣。因为如果你是激进式创新怎么办？那会如何改变你的策略？因为显然你不想让他们侵蚀你的创新类型。但这是否会将你与渐进式创新区分开来……

  **32:45 - 35:00: Technology Radar: From Signals to Strategy**

  **Professor:** Good thinking. But you need to know how this, the Radar, is coined. Anybody who has seen Radar before? This Radar, Technology Radar, actually originated from Cisco, the company. Anyone has done it? Okay. Radar is a powerful... I'll maybe, since you are not aware, I'll have a class on Radar itself. But Radar goes through all the three steps that are mentioned out here: the perceiving and prospecting. It basically... what it does is, in Radar, you scan the environment. Like what happened in Carlson's article, the second step. Go and scan the environment for information. And once you scan the environment, you start analyzing for what are the strong signals, what are the weak signals. And what are worth investing, what are not worth investing.

  If some things you feel as a group is worth investing further, you are going to probe into them. Invest money. "Oh, this, for example, AI is going to kill me down the line. So let me park certain portion of my budget into AI so that tomorrow I'm not going to be killed. I am ready kind of." If certain things you don't get clear signals... like for Blockchain, you feel like, "I don't know whether I should invest in." What you do is you start monitoring them.

  So based on the scan signals that comes in, you try to prioritize your R&D strategy into different buckets. Some are of immediate value, some are of long-term value, and some are of very futuristic one. Okay? Very futuristic one... maybe you are not bidding today, but it can come and kill you later. So you want to monitor it to see *when* I need to invest in it.

  Immediate one: high importance. Go put it there so that you are not being killed. Moderate one: they are not of that great importance. So what I'll do is I'll have a class to tell you how the Cisco Radar is all about. And what is more interesting is all the technology intelligence process that you undertake is a powerful communication tool.

  **Chinese Translation**

  **教授：** 很好的思考。但你需要知道这个“雷达”是如何构思出来的。有人以前见过雷达吗？这个雷达，技术雷达，实际上源自思科（Cisco）这家公司。有人做过吗？好吧。雷达是一个强大的……也许，既然你们不了解，我会专门上一节关于雷达的课。但雷达经历了这里提到的所有三个步骤：感知和展望。基本上……它所做的是，在雷达中，你扫描环境。就像卡尔森（Carlson）文章中提到的第二步。去扫描环境以获取信息。一旦你扫描了环境，你就开始分析哪些是强信号，哪些是弱信号。哪些值得投资，哪些不值得投资。

  如果作为一个团队，你们觉得某些东西值得进一步投资，你们就会去探索它们。投入资金。“噢，例如，人工智能（AI）将来会扼杀我。所以我要把一部分预算投入到 AI 中，这样明天我就不会被淘汰。我已经做好了某种准备。”如果某些事情你没有得到明确的信号……比如区块链，你觉得，“我不知道是否应该投资。”你要做的就是开始监控它们。

  因此，基于进入的扫描信号，你试图将你的研发策略按优先级分入不同的桶中。有些具有即时价值，有些具有长期价值，还有一些是非常未来导向的。好吗？非常未来导向的……也许你今天不押注，但它以后可能会来扼杀你。所以你要监控它，看看我*何时*需要投资它。

  即时的：高度重要。去把它放在那里，这样你就不会被淘汰。中等的：它们没那么重要。所以我将上一节课告诉你们思科雷达是怎么回事。更有趣的是，你们进行的所有技术情报过程都是一个强大的沟通工具。

  **35:00 - 37:00: Interpreting the Radar: Projects and Strategic Choices**

  **Professor:** If you were to present the Radar of your company, it will showcase all the... you know, the blocks and triangles that you see, they are nothing but projects of a firm. And the projects are split into whether they are radical, like what she said, incremental... whether they have immediate business potential or long-term business potential... how important they are... and how close they are. This is the TRL level that Seng Meng was mentioning. Some are market-ready projects and some are very basic projects.

  And in just a look at this Radar, you know if your company is being currently profitable as well as futuristic or not. Because if they haven't invested anything in the peripheral, which means they are not being futuristic. Right? And it could be a strategic choice of company saying, "I don't want to invest in anything basic. I am very applied in nature because I care about bread and butter." Okay. If it is a strategic choice, it's okay. Then you cannot expect to be in the forefront of innovation if you have projects only in this one... in this part. Right?

  So as a company, you will know where you stand in terms of whether your projects are only here or are there. Are they all radical in nature? Which means radical projects will take a long time for you to fetch money, but it can fetch a lot of money. Are you happy with that? Some companies decide to do that. Especially those working on rare diseases in biopharma industry. It takes a long time, right? Or blockbuster drugs, right? It takes a long time sometimes, but it fetches you a lot of money.

  **Chinese Translation**

  **教授：** 如果你要展示你公司的雷达，它将展示所有的……你知道，你看到的那些方块和三角形，它们不过是一家公司的项目。这些项目被分为是激进的（就像她说的），还是渐进的……它们是具有即时商业潜力还是长期商业潜力……它们有多重要……以及它们有多接近。这就是 Seng Meng 提到的技术就绪指数（TRL）水平。有些是市场就绪的项目，有些是非常基础的项目。

  仅仅看一眼这个雷达，你就知道你的公司目前是既盈利又面向未来，还是并非如此。因为如果他们没有在边缘领域投资任何东西，这意味着他们没有面向未来。对吧？这可能是公司的一种战略选择，说：“我不想投资任何基础的东西。我本质上非常注重应用，因为我关心的是生计（面包和黄油）。”好吧。如果是战略选择，那没问题。那么，如果你的项目只在这个……在这个部分，你就不能指望处于创新的前沿。对吧？

  所以作为一家公司，你会知道自己的立场，即你的项目是只在这里还是在那里。它们本质上都是激进的吗？这意味着激进的项目需要很长时间才能为你带来资金，但它可以带来很多资金。你对此满意吗？有些公司决定这样做。特别是那些在生物制药行业研究罕见疾病的公司。这需要很长时间，对吧？或者重磅炸弹药物，对吧？有时这需要很长时间，但它会为你带来很多钱。

  **37:00 - 39:12: Wrapping Up Benchmarking and Advice for SMEs**

  **Professor:** And... um... it also talks about... you know... it also helps employees decide on which project they want to work on because knowledge management is also about employees choosing projects if they want to work on. If you are interested only in radical projects, probably you have to go look at the Radar and start looking at *who* is running the project and start approaching them as well. You know? A Radar is a powerful communication tool as well as foresighting tool. Let me cover the details in one of the lessons because it's one of the tools as well.

  But as an intelligence analyst, when you went through this benchmarking report, a graph like this should have piqued your interest. You may not know the details or you need not know the details of it, but you need to understand what it is actually. That homework you should have done. Okay? That skill is something which you need to develop if you want to be an intelligence specialist. Everything cannot be... if everything is spit out to you like one of the students shared, right? Everything is shown in the form of an industry report published. By then it's too late. Okay? You need to probe and dig it and find it out.

  Um... I think that's pretty much about the benchmarking report. We have answered all the questions that are out there. I... I provide the answers here for those questions, but most of it we have discussed over it. Okay.

  This is the last slide. So what can small companies do if they cannot do foresighting? They look at at least their past blind spot where they have failed so that they don't repeat the mistake. And if there is an instructive analogy from... how do you... how do you pronounce it? Anala... analogy from other industries that you want to... because this is what happened in the case of... um... nanotechnology. What happened is when nanotechnology was picking up in the biopharma sector, they looked at what happened with genetically modified crops with another technology and then they tried to learn lessons from it to overcome the chasm in the industry. Okay? So you look for, you know, lessons from other industries, you learn from it.

  And what are your mavericks and outliers trying to tell you? What are the peripheral customers/clients thinking about? This is where your government organizations can help you in helping SMEs. And who in the industry is skilled at picking up weak signals and acting on them before everyone does? As a small and medium enterprise, if you can't invest in foresighting, it is okay. But closely monitor another company which is in the forefront of innovation and closely follow them. That's good enough. That's just a lesson for small and medium enterprises. That's it for today.

  **Chinese Translation**

  **教授：** 而且……嗯……它还谈到了……你知道……它还可以帮助员工决定他们想参与哪个项目，因为知识管理也关乎员工选择他们想做的项目。如果你只对激进的项目感兴趣，可能你就得去看看雷达，开始关注*谁*在负责这个项目，并开始接触他们。你知道吗？雷达既是一个强大的沟通工具，也是一个预测工具。我会在其中一节课中详细介绍，因为它也是一种工具。

  但作为一名情报分析师，当你阅读这份基准报告时，像这样的图表应该已经引起了你的兴趣。你可能不知道细节，或者你不必知道细节，但你需要理解它实际上是什么。那个功课你应该已经做过了。好吗？如果你想成为一名情报专家，这种技能是你需要培养的。并非所有事情都能……如果所有事情都像刚才一位学生分享的那样直接喂给你，对吧？所有事情都以发布的行业报告形式展示。那时就已经太晚了。好吗？你需要探索、挖掘并找出它。

  嗯……我想关于基准报告的内容就差不多是这些了。我们已经回答了那里列出的所有问题。我……我在这里提供了这些问题的答案，但大部分我们都已经讨论过了。好的。

  这是最后一张幻灯片。那么，如果不做预测，小公司能做什么呢？他们至少要看看过去失败的盲点，以免重蹈覆辙。如果有一个来自……你怎么……你怎么发音？类……类比（Analogy）……来自其他行业的具有指导意义的类比，你想去……因为这就是在……嗯……纳米技术案例中发生的事情。当纳米技术在生物制药领域兴起时，他们查看了另一种技术在转基因作物上发生了什么，然后试图从中吸取教训，以跨越行业的鸿沟。好吗？所以你寻找，你知道的，来自其他行业的教训，并从中学习。

  还有，你的特立独行者（Mavericks）和局外人（Outliers）试图告诉你什么？边缘客户/委托人在想什么？这正是政府组织可以帮助中小企业（SME）的地方。行业中谁擅长捕捉微弱信号并在所有人之前采取行动？作为一家中小企业，如果你不能投资于预测，那没关系。但要密切关注另一家处于创新前沿的公司，并紧跟他们。这就足够了。这只是给中小企业的一个教训。今天就到这里。

  **40:00 - 41:15: Conclusion of Benchmarking and Group Formation Logistics**

  **Professor:** Okay, so that's benchmarking. It's one report, but it teaches all the skills needed for foresighting at all levels. Okay?

  If there are any questions, I'll be happy to answer. The webcast is out there. By the way, there are some students who want to join other groups. So if groups are looking for more members, you can post it on the forum seeking groupmates, and others can join. Use the forum to discuss that. If not, those groups willing to take in more students, please raise your hand; the person can approach you now itself.

  But it's not mandatory for you to form groups right now. Take your time to see who is asking, who is performing, and then form the groups, mark you. Alright? Okay.

  **Chinese Translation**

  **教授：** 好的，这就是基准测试。虽然这只是一份报告，但它教授了各级预测所需的所有技能。好吗？

  如果有任何问题，我很乐意回答。网络直播已经发布了。顺便说一下，有些学生想加入其他小组。所以，如果有些小组正在寻找更多成员，你们可以在论坛上发布寻找组员的帖子，其他人可以加入。请使用论坛讨论这个问题。如果没有在论坛上讨论，那些愿意接收更多学生的小组，请举手；想加入的同学现在就可以直接找你们。

  但是，并不强制要求你们现在就组建小组。花点时间看看谁在提问，谁表现得好，然后再组建小组，请记住这一点。好吗？好的。
## Week 3
  - [18:03 - 18:08] **Discussion Forum Feedback & AI Usage Policy**

    Let's look at the discussion forum. I'm pretty happy compared to last year's performance; it's much healthier this time, right? I am very pleased with the way it is going. Now, please, for heaven's sake—I'm not saying "don't use ChatGPT," because I can't forbid that. If I were allowed to ban it, I would happily say "Don't." Do you remember? Last semester there was a group—and for those who were in my class last year, I told them blatantly to their faces: "If you can't explain what is on your slide, clearly it is not your work, right?" And definitely, of course, they were pissed off with me. Do I care? Why should I care? It's your learning; you should be more concerned than me. Some of my colleagues are very kind and polite, but sorry, I'm not like that. If you want to throw your anger at me in the feedback, go ahead. But I'm here to do justice to my job.

    So, if you are using ChatGPT, do so, but *own it*. Use it like a learner. I don't actually believe in banning it, but don't just spit out whatever is there. Try to use it to augment or enhance your work. That's better. And trust me, it's not very hard for faculty members to make out if it's ChatGPT or your own work. It's not hard at all; I don't need any sophisticated tools. So try to use it, really, but use it wisely. Have your own critical analysis.

    See, I'm helping my son prepare his essays for his college applications. Of course we use ChatGPT. But the way we do it is we input our experience first. We write the skeleton ourselves first, and then ask it to tell us: "Where are the gaps? Where are the flaws? Where could it be strengthened?" Use it wisely. I'm pretty sure you are all more savvy than me in terms of using AI. Put in your experience.

    There are some threads in the forum which are very simple, but what I care about is: *How did you do Technology Intelligence (TI)?* Don't just tell me "My company adopted this new technology." That gives the context, but I want to know what *kind* of TI activity you did. Please explain that so I can learn, because different companies use different methods. And on that note, let me ask: how many of you were doing TI activities without knowing you were actually helping with intelligence or foresighting before coming to this module? Quite a few of you, right? This happens every time. You do the activities, but you don't know how it fits into the organization's bigger picture. It's not rocket science. We do this in our day-to-day lives. Someone mentioned in their post about the national level—we do it at the country level, the industry level, and the firm level. Spinning your ideas and cross-sharing is what we are looking for.

    咱们先来看看论坛讨论区的情况。相比去年，我对这次的表现非常满意，大家的讨论氛围更健康了，我很欣慰。不过，看在上帝的份上——我不是说“不准用ChatGPT”，因为规定不允许我这么说。如果我有权禁止，我会很乐意地说“别用”。还记得吗？上学期有个小组——去年上过我课的同学都知道——我当面直截了当地告诉他们：“如果你们连自己幻灯片上的内容都解释不清楚，那显然这根本不是你们的作品，对吧？”当然，他们肯定生我的气。但我会在乎吗？我为什么要在这乎？这是你们的学习，你们应该比我更上心才对。我有些同事可能很和善客气，但不好意思，我不是那种人。如果你想在课程反馈里发泄怒火，请便。但我必须对得起我的工作。

    所以，如果你要用ChatGPT，没问题，但要“驾驭”它。像个学习者一样去用。我并不相信完全禁用，但别只是把AI生成的东西原封不动地吐出来。试着用它来增强或提升你的工作，这才是正道。相信我，老师们要分辨是ChatGPT写的还是你写的并不难，一点都不难，我根本不需要什么复杂的检测工具。所以，聪明地使用它，保留你自己的批判性分析。

    就像我在帮我儿子准备大学申请文书一样。我们当然也会用ChatGPT，但我们的做法是先把我们的经历输进去。我们先写好骨架，然后问它：“哪里有缺漏？哪里有逻辑缺陷？哪里可以加强？”要聪明地用。我相信你们在玩AI方面比我精明多了。要把你的经验加进去。

    论坛里有些帖子写得很简单，但我关心的是：*你是如何进行技术情报（TI）活动的？* 别只告诉我“我公司采用了这项新技术”。这只是背景。我想知道你具体做了什么样的情报工作？请解释清楚，这样我也能学习，因为不同公司的方法各异。说到这，我想问问，有多少人在上这门课之前，其实已经在做情报或预见活动，却不知道自己是在做这个？挺多人的，对吧？每次上课都这样。你们在做这些事，却不知道它们如何在组织的大局中发挥作用。这其实不是什么火箭科学（高深学问），我们在日常生活中都在做。就像有同学在帖子里提到的，我们在国家层面、行业层面、公司层面都在做。我们要的就是这种思想碰撞和分享。

  - [18:08 - 18:11] **Overview of Agenda: Cases and T-Up**

    Today, what we are going to do is focus on the two cases you read: **Nucor Corporation** and **Longs Drugs**. We'll do a group activity on them so that there is some synergy built with your classmates. That's more on the incentives part. We will also talk a little bit about challenges. What are the challenges when it comes to doing Intelligence and Foresighting activities in organizations? Quite a few threads in the discussion forum already highlighted some of those challenges, so when I deal with that topic, I'll pick out those threads and reinforce them.

    After the incentives discussion, I'll share about my consulting project which I did for A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research) on foresighting and intelligence activities. This was at the national level, but targeting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Just like how one student shared last week about the "100 Experiments" initiative—how to equip Singapore with AI capabilities—when they did that, they looked at all sectors. My project was similar. It looked at the workforce, schools, higher education institutes, and researchers.

    How many of you know about the **T-Up** (Technology for Enterprise Capability Upgrading) program of A*STAR? Nobody? Basically, I was funded by the NRF (National Research Foundation) to study the effectiveness of T-Up. Maybe when I tell the story, you might become familiar with it. I'll share that after the break. It’s about intelligence and foresighting at the national level, but applied to firms. Right now, to recap the last few weeks: we did TI (Technology Intelligence) at a high level using the conference article. In the next two weeks, I'll give you the theoretical foundation of TI activities—how do you structure an organization, etc. Then we looked at *why* it is important: because it helps firms perform better both in the short and long term. Any questions so far? Very straightforward? Okay, good.

    今天我们的安排是这样的：大家应该都读过**Nucor Corporation（纽克钢铁）**和**Longs Drugs（朗斯药店）**这两个案例了吧？我们今天会围绕这两个案例做一个小组活动，增进大家之间的协作。这部分主要关于激励机制。我们还会讨论一下挑战——在组织中进行情报和预见活动时会面临哪些挑战？讨论区里很多帖子已经提到了一些挑战，稍后讲到这个话题时，我会把那些观点挑出来加以强调。

    讨论完激励机制后，我会分享我为新加坡科技研究局（A*STAR）做的一个咨询项目，是关于预见和情报活动的。虽然是国家层面的项目，但目标对象是中小企业（SME）。就像上周有同学分享的“100个实验”计划——如何让新加坡具备AI能力——这涉及到所有行业。我的项目也是类似的，考察了劳动力、学校、高等教育机构以及研究人员等所有利益相关者。

    在座有多少人知道A*STAR的**T-Up（企业技术升级）**计划？没人知道吗？好吧，基本上这是国家研究基金会（NRF）资助我通过这个计划去研究其有效性的项目。也许等我讲故事的时候你们就熟了。休息回来后我会分享这个案例。它讲的是国家层面的情报预见如何应用于企业。回顾过去几周：我们通过会议文章从高层次了解了技术情报（TI）。接下来的两周，我会讲授TI活动的理论基础——如何构建组织等等。我们还探讨了*为什么*它很重要：因为它能帮助企业在短期和长期都表现得更好。到目前为止有什么问题吗？都很简单明了？好的。

  - [18:11 - 18:31] **Challenges of Foresighting: Student Perspectives**

    When we look at TI or foresighting activities, we know what it is and why it's important. But what are some of the challenges in doing it? That's the topic today. Why do you think it's hard to do foresighting or intelligence in an organization?

    *Student A:* It feels like a textbook concept. There is a disparity; foresighting is actually not being done by the nurses (practitioners) themselves. It's more about awareness and capabilities.

    *Lecturer:* So you're saying it's about not having the in-house awareness and capabilities?

    *Student B:* I also think that these days, organizations try to delegate these tasks to experimental teams. They are trying to catch up to best practices in the industry. Their forecasting is more like "what's going on in the industry currently" and trying to adopt technologies for it. Spending too much on experiments and R&D may not be seen as viable or feasible.

    *Lecturer:* So, one constraint is time and resources. Another is the "wait and watch" attitude—let others do it and then follow.

    *Student C:* More of a practical issue... priorities are all controlled by deadlines. We are always trying to chase these deadlines. Bosses can say "you need to explore R&D," but those are all secondary projects which ultimately no one has time for.

    *Lecturer:* A systemic gap. Always fighting today's battle rather than looking at the future. Very good.

    *Student D:* There are different tiers of people. The lower-level/junior people don't want to change because they can't see the benefit, and change means more work. Freshmen from university might want to rectify the workplace initially, but after half a year, they change (and give up). Middle managers don't want change because it threatens their position. And for the higher level, for them, change might mean "courting death" because the future is unknown. If they go in the wrong direction, they fail.

    *Lecturer:* This summarizes a discussion forum post written by Cheng Heng Lee—are you here? Ah, never mind. That student neatly pointed out that firms are often inward-looking, which constrains their ability to recognize disruptive innovations. People don't want change because they could be displaced. And senior executives are worried about taking the wrong direction—like someone shared last week about a leader throwing the company in a direction that failed dramatically.

    *Student E:* In my company, there is a disconnection in communication between top senior management and the lower level in the field. My company doesn't have a system for reporting these foresighting touchpoints. Sometimes it's up to the person whether they feel something is important enough to report. So there's a mismatch.

    *Lecturer:* Very practical point. Top-down is enforced, and bottom-up is not heard. I'll tell you a practical challenge: I knew a person in an organization who was literally crying, saying, "Hey, this technology is disrupting us!" He attended conferences and knew it was coming. He tried to communicate this to the boss, but no one was ready to hear. He was ignored. So what did he do next time? He didn't bother. He said, "I'll do my minimum to get my salary and move on." According to a survey, many knowledge workers only give a small percentage of their capability to their organizations partly because they are not being heard. That's why knowledge management and having a "sense-making" culture (as Karishma mentioned in the forum) is vital.

    *Student F (SME Context):* For an SME in the energy field, the advantage of being a first mover is not very high. For example, we purchased solar panels at 25-26 cents, and now the rate is 7-10 cents. The first mover advantage isn't really there to justify forecasting. Also, energy markets are volatile. The first person to enter often bears the burden of being the most expensive.

    *Lecturer:* Very good point. For an SME, it can be tricky. Unless you are betting on Intellectual Property (IP) protection to sell to big players, don't be too aggressive on pricing because you cannot beat the big players. You need to play smart.

    当我们审视技术情报或预见活动时，我们知道它的定义和重要性。但在实际操作中有哪些挑战呢？这就是今天的主题。你们觉得为什么在组织里做预见或情报工作这么难？

    *学生A：*这感觉太像教科书里的概念了。现实中有差距，预见工作通常不是由一线人员（比如护士）自己做的。更多是因为缺乏内部的意识和能力。

    *教授：*你是说是因为内部缺乏这种意识和能力？

    *学生B：*我觉得现在很多组织倾向于把这些任务外包给专门的实验团队。他们试图追赶行业的最佳实践。他们的“预测”更多是看“行业里现在发生了什么”，然后试图采用相应的技术。在实验和研发上投入太多，可能被视为不可行或不划算。

    *教授：*所以，一个是时间和资源的限制。另一个是“观望”态度——等别人先做，然后跟风。

    *学生C：*更实际的问题是……优先级都被截止日期控制了。我们总是在赶死线。老板可能会说“你们需要探索研发”，但那些都是次要项目，最终根本没人有时间去做。

    *教授：*这是系统性差距。总是忙着打今天的仗，顾不上看未来。说得很好。

    *学生D：*不同层级的人有不同想法。底层员工不想改变，因为看不到好处，改变意味着更多工作量。刚毕业的新人可能一开始想整顿职场，但半年后就被同化了。中层管理者不想改变，因为这威胁到他们的职位。而对于高层来说，改变可能意味着“找死”，因为未来是未知的。如果方向走错了，公司就完了。

    *教授：*这总结了Cheng Heng Lee在论坛里的帖子——你在吗？算了。那位同学指出，企业往往过于向内看，限制了识别颠覆性创新的能力。员工不想变是因为怕被取代。高管则担心走错方向——就像上周有人分享的，领导者指错方向导致公司惨败。

    *学生E：*在我公司，高层管理和一线人员之间的沟通是断层的。我们没有汇报这些预见触点的系统。有时候汇报不汇报完全看个人感觉。所以存在错配。

    *教授：*非常实际的观点。自上而下是强制执行，自下而上却没人听。我讲个真事：有个员工几乎是哭着喊：“嘿，这项技术正在颠覆我们！”他去参加会议，知道狼来了。他试图告诉老板，但没人听。结果呢？下次他就不费劲了。他说：“我就做最低限度的工作，拿薪水走人。”调查显示，很多知识型员工只发挥了一小部分能力，部分原因就是他们的声音没人听。这就是为什么知识管理和“意义构建”（sense-making，正如Karishma在论坛提到的）至关重要。

    *学生F（中小企业背景）：*对于能源领域的中小企业，先发优势并不大。比如我们在25-26美分时买了太阳能板，现在价格降到了7-10美分。先发者往往要承担最高昂的成本，所以我们对做预见比较怀疑。

    *教授：*这点很好。对中小企业来说这很棘手。除非你是在押注知识产权（IP）保护，然后卖给大公司，否则别在价格上太激进，因为你拼不过大玩家。你得玩得聪明点。

  - [18:32 - 18:35] **Barriers to Foresight Literature**

    If you look at the literature, this is what has been listed as challenges or barriers to foresight. It's not just that foresight capability is lacking. In fact, the capability is often there. The reasons are:

    1. Foresighting is not heard because it is viewed as intangible without much immediate value.
    2. Foresighting is perceived as threatening (as you all mentioned—job loss, change is scary).
    3. Foresight competes for attention. This is one of the most important points.

    Managers are fighting for today rather than looking at the future. In a benchmarking report, researchers asked: "Is a manager more likely to lose his or her job if sales numbers were missed, or if the opportunity to enter a new market was missed?" The answer was overwhelmingly the first one. If I miss that low-hanging fruit (sales targets), I am penalized much more heavily than if I miss a future opportunity. That's why everyone is looking at market size, sales volume, and profit potential *today*, rather than asking: "What will the company be like in 5 or 10 years?"

    For example, CO2 capture is a big topic now for energy efficiency. But how many are really investing in CO2 capture research? There is a famous professor in the Chemical Engineering department at NUS who looks at CO2 capture in the form of gas hydrates. He's a good friend of mine; my son even did an internship in his lab. It's top-notch research, but how long will it take to bring to market? These are far-fetched questions for many firms.

    如果你查阅文献，会发现预见的障碍通常被归结为以下几点。不仅仅是因为缺乏预见能力，事实上能力往往是存在的。真正的原因是：

    1. 预见的声音没人听，因为它被视为无形的，没有太多即时价值。
    2. 预见被视为一种威胁（正如你们提到的——失业、对改变的恐惧）。
    3. 预见在“争夺注意力”。这是最重要的一点。

    管理者都在为今天而战，而不是关注未来。在一份基准报告中，研究人员问：“如果一个经理没完成销售指标，或者错过了进入新市场的机会，哪种情况更容易导致他丢饭碗？”答案压倒性地指向第一种。如果我没摘到“低垂的果实”（当下销售目标），我受到的惩罚远比错过未来机会要重。这就是为什么大家都在关注*当下*的市场规模、销量和利润潜力，而不是问：“5年或10年后公司会变成什么样？”

    比如，二氧化碳（CO2）捕获现在是能源效率的大热门。但有多少人真正投资于CO2捕获的研究？新加坡国立大学化工系有一位著名教授专门研究气体水合物形式的CO2捕获。他是我好朋友，我儿子还在他实验室实习过。这是顶尖的研究，但要推向市场需要多久？对很多公司来说，这些问题太遥远了。

  - [18:35 - 18:39] **Introduction to Group Activity: Incentive Structures**

    If those are the challenges, how can you mitigate them? We'll look at some solutions in the form of **incentives** today. Of course, company culture and structure also matter, which we will cover in the next two weeks. But if you fix incentives, things will often fall in place.

    I had a conversation with an ex-boss yesterday at midnight. He was talking about "eating the frog"—if you have to eat a big frog, eat the brain first, and the rest will fall in place because the brain is the most important thing. Likewise, the easiest thing to work on to mitigate these challenges is fixing incentives—money, stock options, perks. When the annual review comes in July, incentives kick in.

    But are organizations having the right incentives? Is your incentive structure good enough? Before we talk about your organizations, let's look at the two cases: **Longs Drugs** and **Nucor**.

    Start working with your group mates. Build a table.

    1. **Longs Drugs:** What are the different levels? (Department Managers and Store Managers). What is expected of them? What is their KPI and incentive structure?
    2. **Nucor:** What are the levels? (Shop Floor, Mini-Mill Managers, Top Management). What is expected? What are the incentives?

    List them down. Then, analyze: Is this incentive structure good enough? If there are loopholes or gaps, tell me how you can address them by tweaking the structure. There are gaps in Longs Drugs which are well addressed in the Nucor case. I want you to find them.

    You have about 15-20 minutes. Time starts now.

    既然存在这些挑战，我们要如何缓解呢？今天我们通过**激励机制**来探讨解决方案。当然，企业文化和结构也很重要，那是接下来两周的内容。但如果你把激励机制搞对了，事情往往就顺了。

    昨天半夜我和一位前老板聊天。他提到“吃青蛙”理论——如果你非吃一只大青蛙不可，先吃脑子，剩下的就容易了，因为脑子最重要。同样地，要缓解这些挑战，最容易入手的就是修正激励机制——钱、期权、津贴。到了七月份年度评估的时候，激励机制就会发挥作用。

    但是，组织的激励机制设对了吗？你们公司的激励结构够好吗？在讨论你们的公司之前，我们先看看这两个案例：**Longs Drugs**和**Nucor**。

    现在开始小组讨论。做一个表格。

    1. **Longs Drugs：** 有哪些层级？（部门经理和店长）。对他们的期望是什么？KPI和激励结构是什么？
    2. **Nucor：** 有哪些层级？（车间工人、微型钢厂经理、高层管理）。期望是什么？激励是什么？

    把它们列出来。然后分析：这种激励结构够好吗？如果存在漏洞或差距，告诉我如何通过调整结构来解决。Longs Drugs里的一些漏洞在Nucor的案例中解决得很好。我希望你们能发现这一点。

    你们大概有15到20分钟。计时开始。

  - [18:39 - 18:59] **Group Activity Break**

    (Students work in groups to analyze the incentive structures of Longs Drugs and Nucor Corporation.)

    （学生分组讨论Longs Drugs和Nucor Corporation的激励机制。）

  - [18:59 - 19:00] **Chinese New Year Performance Announcement**

    (Returning from break) Just a quick announcement. For the Indian students, you would love this opportunity because you can go to India and come back, but they want a multicultural performance. Is there anyone who is good with any kind of art form? As a group or individuals? Lion dance or anything that can showcase you in the Chinese New Year period (16th to 18th February)? Let me know.

    （休息回来）插播一个通知。印度的同学们，你们可能会喜欢这个机会，因为可以回印度再回来，但他们需要一个多元文化的表演。有没有人擅长某种艺术形式？小组或个人都行？舞狮或者任何能在农历新年期间（2月16日至18日）展示才艺的？请告诉我。

  - [19:00 - 19:04] **Longs Drugs Analysis: Incentives & Strategy**

    Let's come back to **Longs Drugs**. What are the two levels? Department Managers and Store Managers.

    **Department Managers:** They are responsible for the gross margins of their specific department. They decide the mix, shelf space, and reordering.

    **Store Managers:** They have "bottom-line" net profit responsibility. They act like entrepreneurs. Their bonus is based on the store's net profit.

    In Longs Drugs, inventory is mostly either "on the shelf" or "on the road." It's a decentralized model. But moving forward, what is the "con" (disadvantage) of that decentralized approach? The price is going to be higher because you don't have the economies of scale from central purchasing. To mitigate that, they are encouraged to do regional contracts with suppliers to get better prices—consolidating purchases—but not to the extent of a fully centralized chain like Walgreens. They are also encouraged to discuss and brainstorm with other store managers on the profit-maximizing product mix.

    Now, given this strategy, are the incentive structures good enough for what they want to achieve? Or do you think there are gaps? We'll address that.

    让我们回到**Longs Drugs**。有两个层级：部门经理和店长。

    **部门经理：** 他们对本部门的毛利（Gross Margins）负责。他们决定产品组合、货架空间和补货。

    **店长：** 他们对门店的“底线”净利润（Net Profit）负责。他们表现得像企业家。他们的奖金基于门店的净利润。

    在Longs Drugs，库存主要要么“在货架上”，要么“在路上”。这是一个去中心化的模式。但是，这种去中心化方法的缺点是什么？进货价格会更高，因为你没有中央采购的规模经济优势。为了缓解这个问题，公司鼓励他们与供应商签订区域性合同以获得更好的价格——整合采购——但不像Walgreens那样完全中心化。公司还鼓励他们与其他店长讨论和头脑风暴，寻找利润最大化的产品组合。

    现在的关键是，考虑到这个战略，现有的激励结构足以实现他们的目标吗？还是说存在差距？我们会讨论这个问题。

  - [19:04 - 19:07] **Nucor Analysis: Carrots and Sticks**

    Now let's look at **Nucor**. What are the three levels? Shop Floor (Production), Mini-Mill Managers, and Top Management.

    **Shop Floor (Vulcraft Joist Workers):**

    You mentioned "carrots," but there were "sticks" too. What are they?

    - **Carrot (Bonus):** Based on team productivity compared to a 1977 benchmark (tons of finished joists).
    - **Stick (Penalty):** If there is a defect, who fixes it? The team must repair the joist *on their own time*. If they can't repair it, they have to buy it back.
    - **Quality Assurance:** Note that the Quality Assurance inspector is *not* part of the fabrication team. Why? Conflict of interest. If they were part of the team, they might pass faulty products to keep the productivity bonus high. The incentive structure has to be different to avoid this.

    **Mini-Mill Managers:**

    Take note of this detail: Their bonus is based on the **Return on Assets (ROA)** of the *entire* steel division (the mill group), not just their own mill. The case mentions a threshold (earnings above 9% ROE for the pool). And to keep their job, they must achieve at least a 14% ROA in their own mill.

    **Top Management:**

    Their incentives have two components:

    1. Bonus on current profitability (Cash).

    2. Deferred compensation (Stock/Cash held back).

       Why? To ensure they focus on the long term.

    现在看看**Nucor**。三个层级：车间（生产）、微型钢厂经理、高层管理。

    **车间（Vulcraft托梁工人）：**

    你们提到了“胡萝卜”（奖励），但也有“大棒”（惩罚）。是什么？

    - **胡萝卜（奖金）：** 基于团队生产力，对比1977年的基准（成品吨数）。
    - **大棒（惩罚）：** 如果出现缺陷，谁来修？团队必须利用*业余时间*免费修复。如果修不好，他们必须把次品买下来。
    - **质量保证：** 注意，质检员*不*属于制造团队。为什么？为了避免利益冲突。如果他们是一伙的，为了拿高产奖金，可能会放行次品。激励结构必须区分开。

    **微型钢厂经理：**

    注意这个细节：他们的奖金是基于*整个*钢铁部门（钢厂集团）的**资产回报率（ROA）**，而不仅仅是他们自己的钢厂。案例提到有一个门槛（净资产收益率ROE超过9%的部分进入奖金池）。而且为了保住饭碗，他们自己的钢厂必须达到至少14%的ROA。

    **高层管理：**

    他们的激励有两部分：

    1. 基于当前盈利能力的奖金（现金）。

    2. 延期薪酬（扣留的股票/现金）。

       为什么？为了确保他们关注长期发展。

  - [19:07 - 19:13] **Comparative Analysis: Individual vs. Group Incentives**

    Why is Nucor's incentive structure designed like this? Is it good?

    *Student:* For the shop floor, since the bonus is given to the group, there might be free riders. But personally, I think if you put in effort, the bonus grows. It's like sales or insurance—you get what you work for.

    *Lecturer:* Okay, fair enough. But let's look deeper.

    *Student:* I think Longs Drugs has a gap. If the store manager only cares about his own store's profit, he competes with others. There is a misalignment. Incentives should be partially based on the department and partially based on the overall region/store.

    *Lecturer:* Exactly. In the Longs Drugs case, they want stores to share best practices. But if I am a store manager and my bonus is 100% tied to *my* store's profit, do I have any incentive to go and share my secrets with you? No! I want the "Best Store Manager Award." I'll keep it a secret.

    So, having a very short-term or purely individual look at incentives will backfire because there won't be a culture of sharing.

    In the case of **Nucor**, it is neatly done. Every incentive is pitched to **one level higher**.

    - Shop floor: Team productivity (Group level).
    - Mini-mill Managers: Bonus is based on the *Group's* profit (Steel Division), not just their own mill.
    - Top Management: Tied to current profit AND future (deferred compensation).

    This structure forces collaboration. Mini-mill managers meet three times a year to share cost-reduction techniques because *my* bonus depends on *your* mill doing well too. If you only incentivize the individual level, you get superstars but no synergy. You need a balance.

    So when you design an incentive structure, always look at **one level and one level higher**.

    为什么Nucor的激励机制这样设计？它好吗？

    *学生：*对于车间来说，既然奖金是给小组的，可能会有“搭便车”（free riders）的人。但我个人觉得，如果你努力，奖金就会多。这就像销售或保险业——多劳多得。

    *教授：*好吧，有道理。但我们要看得更深一点。

    *学生：*我觉得Longs Drugs有差距。如果店长只关心自己店的利润，他就会和其他店竞争。这里有错位。激励应该部分基于部门表现，部分基于整体区域或门店表现。

    *教授：\*正是如此。在Longs Drugs的案例中，公司希望门店分享最佳实践。但如果我是店长，我的奖金100%挂钩于\*我的*门店利润，我有动力去跟你分享我的秘诀吗？没有！我想要“最佳店长奖”。我会保守秘密。

    所以，目光短浅或纯粹个人的激励机制会适得其反，因为这建立不起分享的文化。

    而在**Nucor**的案例中，设计非常精妙。每一级的激励都锚定在**高一级**的层面。

    - 车间：团队生产力（小组层面）。
    - 微型钢厂经理：奖金基于*集团*利润（钢铁部门），而不只是自己的钢厂。
    - 高层管理：挂钩当前利润以及未来（延期薪酬）。

    这种结构强迫协作。微型钢厂经理每年聚会三次分享降本技术，因为*我的*奖金也取决于*你的*钢厂表现。如果你只激励个人层面，你会得到超级明星，但没有协同效应。你需要平衡。

    所以设计激励结构时，永远要关注**本级和高一级**。

  - [19:13 - 19:15] **Lecturer's Anecdote: NUS Incentive Structure**

    Think about your own organizations. Are your incentives good enough?

    For example, in my department at NUS, we are all faculty members. Many times I don't even come to the office because I work on my research, teaching, and mentoring. I work with collaborators outside Singapore (Europe, Canada) more than with colleagues here.

    It's good for *me*—I get grants. But is it good for collegiality within the department? No.

    So, my Head of Department created an incentive: "If there is interdisciplinary research happening *within* the group, I will park a specific pool of money for that research." That is an incentive for me to talk to my colleague and say, "Hey, can we go and tap into this pool together?"

    It brings synergy. Without it, individually we do well, but when an external audit comes, they ask: "How good are you as a group?" That matters for retention too. If there is no friendship, no collegiality, why would I want to stay here in the long run?

    想以此反思你们自己的组织。激励机制够好吗？

    比如，在新加坡国立大学我们系，大家都是教员。很多时候我甚至不去办公室，因为我忙着做研究、教学和指导学生。我跟新加坡以外（欧洲、加拿大）的合作者共事的时间，比跟这里同事共事的时间还多。

    这对*我*个人是好事——我拿到了资助。但这有利于系里的同僚情谊吗？并没有。

    所以，我的系主任设立了一个激励措施：“如果组内有*跨学科*研究，我会专门拨一笔钱支持。”这就是我去跟同事说话的动力：“嘿，我们要不要一起去申请这笔钱？”

    这带来了协同效应。没有这个，我们单打独斗都不错，但外部审计来的时候会问：“作为一个团队，你们有多强？”这也关系到留任率。如果没有友谊，没有同僚情谊，我为什么要长期留在这里？

  - [19:15 - 19:34] **Student Discussion: Sales vs. Finance & Performance Ratings**

    *Lecturer:* How many of you are still assessed on a scale of 1 to 5? Is it comprehensive enough?

    *Student A (Medical/Research):* For us, it involves bedside research, publishing... lots of expectations and no time to do it.

    *Lecturer:* You're being diplomatic. Okay, for me, if you do your core job well (teaching, foundation), you get a standard grade. What brings the "A" or "A Star" are the **CCAs** (Co-Curricular Activities)—additional activities the boss appoints to stretch you. But are you compensated well enough for that extra work? Or is it just a hygiene factor?

    *Student B (Sales vs. Finance Conflict):* I want to share a specific gap in my sales department. Salespeople get commission based on **Purchase Orders (POs)**. So they care about getting as many clients as possible. But then the Finance department has to chase these clients to collect payment. The salespeople say, "We did our part, we sold it. Collection is your problem." But they bring in bad clients. The incentive should not just be on the PO amount, but on the *actual amount collected*.

    *Lecturer:* Very true. This happens in many companies—Singapore, Thailand, everywhere. "I got the client, you deal with the mess." I can totally relate.

    *Student C (SME vs. MNC):* I've worked in a foreign MNC, a local MNC, and a small SME.

    - **SME:** Usually just salary. No deferred compensation. Bonus is random—"profit is up, here's a bonus." Not structured.

    - **Foreign MNC:** Two-way appraisal. Different levels of grading.

    - **Local MNC:** Somewhere in between.

      But in an SME, it's about managing your boss. One boss handles everyone. It's subjective.

    *Lecturer:* Yes, in an SME, you don't have the layers, but the chance of being noticed is higher. If you do well, you get more responsibility (and maybe more pay). In Singapore/Asia, "reward" often means "more work," right? But you get visibility.

    Regarding appraisals, some MNCs do **two-way appraisals** (you rate the boss too). But research shows a bias—female employees often rate female bosses lower than male bosses. I've seen this in my own class ratings too! Male students gave me 4.9, female students gave me 4.3. I was like, "What the hell did I do?" So, bias exists.

    *教授：*你们中有多少人还在用1到5分的评分制？这够全面吗？

    *学生A（医疗/研究）：*对我们要来说，涉及临床研究、发表论文……期望很高，但没时间做。

    *教授：*你说话很外交辞令啊。好吧，对我来说，如果你做好了核心工作（教学、基础），你只能拿个标准分。想要拿到“A”或“A星”，得靠**CCA**（辅助课程活动）——老板指派给你的额外任务，用来磨练你。但这些额外工作有足够的补偿吗？还是仅仅被当作理所当然？

    *学生B（销售与财务的冲突）：\*我想分享销售部门的一个具体差距。销售人员的提成是基于**采购订单（PO）**的。所以他们只管拉尽可能多的客户。然后财务部门得去追着这些人讨债。销售人员说：“我们完事了，卖出去了。收款是你们的问题。”结果他们招来一堆烂客户。激励机制不应该只基于订单金额，而应该基于\*实际收回的款项*。

    *教授：*太真实了。这在很多公司都发生——新加坡、泰国，到处都是。“我拉来了客户，烂摊子归你。”我完全能感同身受。

    *学生C（中小企业 vs 跨国公司）：*我在外资跨国公司、本土跨国公司和小型中小企业都做过。

    - **中小企业：** 通常只有死工资。没有延期薪酬。奖金很随意——“今年利润不错，发个红包。”没有结构化。

    - **外资跨国公司：** 双向评估。分级很细。

    - **本土跨国公司：** 介于两者之间。

      但在中小企业，主要是看怎么“管理”你的老板。一个老板管所有人。很主观。

    *教授：*是的，中小企业没有那么多层级，但你被注意到的机会也更高。如果你做得好，你会得到更多责任（也许还有更多钱）。在新加坡或亚洲，“奖励”往往意味着“更多工作”，对吧？但你能得到曝光度。

    关于评估，有些跨国公司做**双向评估**（你也给老板打分）。但研究显示存在偏见——女性员工给女性老板打的分通常比给男性老板低。我在我自己的课程评分里也见过！男学生给我4.9分，女学生给我4.3分。我想：“我到底做错了什么？”所以，偏见是存在的。

  - [19:34 - 19:37] **New Employee Probation & Unspoken Rules**

    *Student:* There is an unspoken rule regarding new employees. Even if you perform well, you get a "C" grade (average) because you are new. It's like a queue system. "I took the fall last year, so you take it this year."

    *Lecturer:* When you say "new," how new? Less than one year?

    *Student:* Yes.

    *Lecturer:* That's fair enough. It's too early to judge. Maybe you came in with a lot of energy, working 24/7, but if I let you work for a year, you might lose steam and deteriorate. They want to see you perform consistently. So if you get an average grade initially, don't worry. If they didn't tell you to "buck up," it's a good sign. Continue the good work, and you should be remunerated the subsequent year.

    *学生：*对于新员工有个潜规则。即使你表现得很好，你也只能拿个“C”档（平均分），因为你是新人。这就像排队一样。“去年我背了锅，今年轮到你了。”

    *教授：*你说的“新”，有多新？不到一年？

    *学生：*是的。

    *教授：\*那很公平。现在下定论太早了。也许你刚来时精力充沛，全天候工作，但如果我让你干满一年，你可能就泄气了，表现下滑。他们想看到你表现的\*持续性*。所以如果起初拿到平均分，别担心。如果他们没叫你“加把劲”，那就是好兆头。继续努力，第二年你应该会得到回报的。

  - [19:37 - 19:38] **Closing Advice: Do Not Get Fired**

    Just because I told you about incentive structures and two-way communication, don't go and argue with your boss anyhow. "Annie (Lecturer) taught me there should be two-way communication, I demand a change!" Don't get fired and talk. I put a disclaimer: I am not responsible for your own actions!

    Same thing for the SMEs here. Don't go and start a massive "Intelligence and Foresighting Department" because it's going to backfire big time. You don't have the bandwidth. Look for blind spots, weak signals from others, and listen to your customers. Do that. Don't get fired and come to me next class.

    We'll take a break and come back to look at **T-Up** (The A*STAR study).

    最后提醒一句，虽然我讲了激励结构和双向沟通，别回去就随便跟老板吵架。“Annie（老师）教我要双向沟通，我要求改革！”别搞得被炒鱿鱼了再来说。我先免责声明：我不对你们的行为负责！

    在座的中小企业也一样。别回去就搞个庞大的“情报与预见部门”，那会彻底搞砸的。你们没有那个带宽（资源）。去寻找盲点，捕捉别人的微弱信号，倾听客户的声音。做这些就够了。别搞到被炒了下节课来找我哭。

    我们要休息一下，回来后讲**T-Up**（A*STAR的研究案例）。

  - [19:51 - 19:57] **Singapore's Transition to a Knowledge-Based Economy**

    The Singapore government commissioned this study, specifically the Economic Development Board (EDB), which funded the whole initiative to help Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). To understand why, you need the background. Those who have been in Singapore for a long time know that up until 1990, the focus was on industrialization. The economy was skill-based; polytechnics and engineering skills were heavily emphasized. While this helped Singapore do well, 1990 marked the transition into a **Knowledge-Based Economy (KBE)**. We became "knowledge-based workers."

    Now, who is a knowledge-based worker? Forget the complex theories. A knowledge worker is defined by the ability to reflect. If you do a job—any activity—and you are able to step back after performing the task and ask yourself: "Could I have done this better? Did I do anything wrong? Had I had a specific tool, would I have performed this job better?"—that differentiates a knowledge worker. It’s about reflective learning. That is why they generalize white-collar workers as knowledge workers, because they are assumed to have that level of critical thinking. Even in the US, some people refuse to become managers because they want to remain champions in their technical area; they are knowledge workers too.

    I mention this because it applies to your personal life. Every year on December 30th or 31st, I ask myself: "How did I spend the last year? What did I achieve monthly? What could I do better?" If you can do that for your last semester, you are already practicing it. After 1990, Singapore realized that skills alone wouldn't help because neighboring countries were becoming skillful and offering lower costs. To remain competitive, the government started pumping money into research. The National Science and Technology Board (NSTB) was established in 1990 and renamed **A\*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)** around 2001/2002. A*STAR became the breeding place for knowledge workers, dramatically increasing the number of PhDs and researchers.

    这项研究是由新加坡政府，特别是经济发展局（EDB）委托并全额资助的，旨在帮助中小企业。为了理解原因，我得先讲讲背景。在新加坡待得久的人都知道，直到1990年，我们的重心都在工业化。那是基于技能的经济，理工学院和工程技能备受推崇。这确实让新加坡发展得不错，但1990年标志着我们向**知识型经济（KBE）**的转型。我们变成了“知识型工作者”。

    那么，谁是知识型工作者？别管那些复杂的理论。知识型工作者的定义在于反思能力。如果你在做完一项工作——任何工作——之后，能够退一步问自己：“我能做得更好吗？我做错了什么吗？如果我有某种工具，这工作会不会做得更出色？”——这就区分了你是不是知识型工作者。关键在于反思性学习。这就是为什么白领通常被归类为知识型工作者，因为人们假设他们具备这种批判性思维。甚至在美国，有些人拒绝升职做经理，因为他们只想在技术领域做顶尖专家，他们也是知识型工作者。

    我提这个是因为这关乎你们的个人生活。每年的12月30日或31日，我都会问自己：“这一年我怎么过的？我每个月达成了什么？哪里可以改进？”如果你能对上学期做同样的复盘，你就已经入门了。1990年后，新加坡意识到光靠技能不够了，因为邻国的技术也在进步，而且成本更低。为了保持竞争力，政府开始向研究领域注入大量资金。国家科技局（NSTB）于1990年成立，并在2001/2002年左右更名为**A\*STAR（新加坡科技研究局）**。A*STAR成了知识型人才的孵化器，博士和研究人员的数量急剧增加。

  - [19:57 - 20:06] **The SME Gap and the GET-Up Initiative (T-Up)**

    Around 2000, the government realized a problem. While there was massive investment in upskilling the workforce and research, SMEs were not growing well. About 65% of employment came from the SME sector, but in terms of nominal value-added, they were lagging. When asked why, SMEs complained: "I'm fighting for my bread and butter today. I'm not thinking about the future. And even if I want to be futuristic, I don't have R&D capabilities. PhDs want to work for large institutes, not SMEs."

    So, in 2003, the government launched a program called **GET-Up (Growing Enterprises through Technology Upgrade)**. It had several components.

    1. **OTR (Operation Technology Roadmap):** **Rob Phaal** from the University of Cambridge, the guru on roadmapping, came to Singapore to train A*STAR staff. Since then, A*STAR has a group that goes into SMEs for 1-2 weeks to chart their R&D strategy.
    2. **Technical Advisors:** SMEs can tap into A*STAR experts for advice.
    3. **T-Up (Technology for Enterprise Capability Upgrading):** This is the key component. It is a secondment program. If an SME needs a researcher, A*STAR sends their employee to the SME.
       - **Year 1:** The researcher is fully paid by the government (EDB). The SME gets "free labor" and high-level knowledge.
       - **Year 2:** The SME must pay roughly 25-50% of the salary.
       - **Goal:** By the end, the SME becomes invested and hopefully hires the researcher permanently or the researcher returns to A*STAR with industry experience. It is essentially headhunting from A*STAR to SMEs to make them futuristic.

    在2000年左右，政府意识到了一个问题。虽然在提升劳动力技能和研究方面投入巨大，但中小企业的发展却不尽如人意。大约65%的就业来自中小企业，但就名义增值而言，它们却掉队了。当被问及原因时，中小企业抱怨道：“我每天都在为生计奔波，哪有空想未来？就算我想搞前沿技术，我也没那个研发能力。博士们都想去大机构，没人愿意来中小企业。”

    因此，政府在2003年推出了**GET-Up（企业技术升级）**计划。它包含几个部分：

    1. **OTR（运营技术路线图）：** 剑桥大学的**Rob Phaal**，他是技术路线图领域的泰斗，亲自来新加坡培训A*STAR的员工。从那时起，A*STAR有一个团队专门入驻中小企业1-2周，帮它们制定研发战略。
    2. **技术顾问：** 中小企业可以利用A*STAR的专家资源获取建议。
    3. **T-Up（企业能力提升技术计划）：** 这是核心部分，即借调计划。如果中小企业需要研究员，A*STAR会派员工去。
       - **第一年：** 研究员的薪水由政府（EDB）全额支付。中小企业获得了“免费劳动力”和高端知识。
       - **第二年：** 中小企业必须承担大约25-50%的薪水。
       - **目标：** 最终，中小企业会对此投入，希望它们能正式聘用该研究员，或者研究员带着行业经验回到A*STAR。这本质上是从A*STAR向中小企业“挖墙脚”，以帮助企业面向未来。

  - [20:06 - 20:15] **Evaluating Effectiveness: Metrics and The "Kill" Success**

    Around 2015, the government wanted to know if this investment paid off economically. I was funded by the NRF to study the effectiveness of T-Up. How do you measure effectiveness?

    - **Financials:** Revenue growth, cost savings.
    - **Innovation:** Number of patents, new products, process improvements.
    - **Growth:** Scaling up, job creation.
    - **Ecosystem:** Are there more entrepreneurs?

    One of you mentioned in the forum that not all foresighting projects result in an executable project. Does killing a project mean failure? No. Discontinuing a project is **cost saving**. It is an opportunity cost saved by not investing in a dead end. So, for SMEs, process improvement or avoiding bad investments is a huge success metric.

    We also looked at a model by **Bozeman** called the "Contingency Effectiveness Model." It says effectiveness depends on: *Who* is transferring? *What* is being transferred? *To whom*? *How* (human mobility vs. patent)? And the *Context*. This guided our study.

    2015年左右，政府想知道这项投资在经济上是否得到了回报。我获得了国家研究基金会（NRF）的资助来研究T-Up的有效性。怎么衡量有效性呢？

    - **财务：** 营收增长，成本节约。
    - **创新：** 专利数量，新产品，流程改进。
    - **增长：** 规模扩大，创造就业。
    - **生态系统：** 是否诞生了更多企业家？

    你们有人在论坛里提到，并非所有的预见项目都会转化为执行项目。那砍掉一个项目算失败吗？不。终止项目实际上是**成本节约**。这意味着你避免了在死胡同里投入资源，从而节省了机会成本。所以对中小企业来说，流程改进或规避错误投资也是巨大的成功指标。

    我们还参考了**Bozeman**提出的“权变有效性模型”。该模型认为有效性取决于：*谁*在转移？转移了*什么*？转移*给谁*？*如何*转移（通过人员流动还是专利）？以及*背景*。这指导了我们的研究。

  - [20:15 - 20:24] **The Matchmaking Failure & The Readiness Matrix**

    We conducted 41 interviews. We found discrepancies: some SMEs were happy, others had nasty things to say. Some researchers felt it was the worst experience ever. We did paired interviews (SME boss + Researcher) to understand why.

    We realized the problem was **bad matchmaking** by the SME Office. It’s like a date funded by the EDB—if matched poorly, it's a waste.

    We developed a framework to explain this based on **Technology Readiness Level (TRL)** and **Demand Readiness Level**.

    - **Low Readiness SME:** Has no clue what they want, no in-house R&D.
    - **High Readiness SME:** Has done in-house R&D, knows exactly what capability they lack.
    - **High TRL Technology:** Mature, plug-and-play, proven.
    - **Low TRL Technology:** Embryonic, conceptual, lab-stage.

    **The Finding:**

    - If you send a **High TRL** (mature) technology, it works for *any* SME (Low or High readiness). It's plug-and-play.
    - If you send a **Low TRL** (conceptual) technology to a **Low Readiness SME**, it is a disaster. The SME boss expects immediate sales, but the researcher is still theorizing.
    - **Low TRL technology only works with High Readiness SMEs.**
    - *Example:* One enlightened SME boss (himself a researcher) took a researcher for a cutting-edge project. In two years, no product, no patent. But the boss was happy because they made progress on a complex idea. He understood the R&D timeline.

    We showed this matrix to the A*STAR board, and they immediately asked: "How many wrong matchmakings have we done?"

    我们进行了41次访谈。我们发现了差异：有些中小企业很高兴，有些则骂骂咧咧。有些研究员觉得这是史上最糟的经历。我们做了配对访谈（中小企业老板+研究员）来找出原因。

    我们意识到问题出在中小企业办公室的**糟糕配对**上。这就像一场由EDB出钱的相亲——如果配对得不好，就是浪费。

    我们基于**技术就绪指数（TRL）\**和\**需求就绪指数**开发了一个框架来解释这一点。

    - **低就绪度中小企业：** 完全不知道自己想要什么，没有内部研发能力。
    - **高就绪度中小企业：** 做过内部研发，清楚知道自己缺什么能力。
    - **高TRL技术：** 成熟，即插即用，经过验证。
    - **低TRL技术：** 萌芽期，概念性，实验室阶段。

    **研究发现：**

    - 如果你输送**高TRL**（成熟）技术，它适用于*任何*中小企业（无论就绪度高低）。因为是即插即用的。
    - 如果你把**低TRL**（概念性）技术输送给**低就绪度中小企业**，那就是场灾难。老板期望立竿见影的销量，而研究员还在搞理论。
    - **低TRL技术只适用于高就绪度中小企业。**
    - *例子：* 有位开明的中小企业老板（自己也是研究员）接收了一名研究员做一个前沿项目。两年里，没产品，没专利。但老板很高兴，因为他们在一个复杂的概念上取得了进展。他理解研发的时间周期。

    当我们向A*STAR董事会展示这个矩阵时，他们立马问：“我们要搞砸了多少次配对？”

  - [20:24 - 20:30] **Economic Impact: The Inverted U-Curve**

    To prove this economically, we used a **Control Group**: SMEs that applied for T-Up but were denied. We compared their performance against those who got it.

    - **Result:** T-Up generally increased revenue, R&D spending, and employment.
    - **Intangible Benefits:** Even without a product, SMEs felt safer having a "Big Brother" (A*STAR) to talk to.
    - **The Inverted U-Curve:** We found that as the number of T-Up secondments increases, SME output increases *up to a point*. Beyond that point, it plateaus. Why? Because the SME becomes self-sufficient in R&D. They don't need the government crutch anymore.
    - **Policy Implication:** If an SME keeps coming back for more T-Up support, at some point, A*STAR should stop helping, because they have already graduated.

    为了从经济角度证明这一点，我们使用了**对照组**：那些申请了T-Up但被拒绝的中小企业。我们将它们的表现与获得支持的企业进行了对比。

    - **结果：** T-Up总体上增加了营收、研发投入和就业。
    - **无形收益：** 即使没有做出产品，中小企业也觉得有个“老大哥”（A*STAR）可以咨询，更有安全感。
    - **倒U型曲线：** 我们发现，随着T-Up借调次数的增加，中小企业的产出在*一定程度上*是增加的。但超过那个点后，增长就停滞了。为什么？因为中小企业在研发上已经能够自给自足了。它们不再需要政府的拐杖。
    - **政策启示：** 如果一家中小企业不断回来申请T-Up支持，到了某个点，A*STAR应该停止资助，因为它们已经“毕业”了。

  - [20:31 - 20:40] **Researcher Benefits & Conclusion**

    The third question was: What's in it for the researcher? Many hated it. They felt "out of sight, out of mind"—friends got promoted while they were away, and they returned to just a $500 certificate.

    - **Success Story:** One female researcher, a scholar from Cambridge, was sent to an SME to make a Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease toolkit. The SME was small, so she was forced to learn *everything*: patents, white space analysis, working with lawyers, cleaning the office, talking to customers. She gained skills she never learned in her PhD. She is now ready to start her own company.
    - **Conclusion:** Researchers only gain these business/commercialization skills if the project is successful. If they just "time pass," they gain nothing.

    **Final Takeaway for you as Analysts:**

    1. **Frame the Question:** Don't just "study impact." Work with stakeholders (EDB, A*STAR, SMEs) to define what value means to each.
    2. **Methodology:** Be ready to use rigorous economic analysis (like QCA - Qualitative Comparative Analysis) for stakeholders like EDB who want hard numbers, while using stories for others.
    3. **Context:** Don't generalize. Success looks different in different contexts.

    Next week, we will look at **Theories on Technology Intelligence**. It will be theory-heavy. Thank you.

    第三个问题是：这对研究员有什么好处？很多人讨厌这个项目。他们觉得“眼不见心不烦”——朋友们都在升职，而他们被外派，回来只拿到一张500块的证书。

    - **成功案例：** 有位女性研究员，剑桥归来的学者，被派去一家中小企业开发手足口病检测试剂盒。因为公司很小，她被迫学习*所有东西*：专利、空白点分析、跟律师打交道、甚至打扫办公室、跟客户谈生意。她学到了读博期间从未学到的技能。她现在已经准备好自己开公司了。
    - **结论：** 研究员只有在项目成功时才能获得这些商业/商业化技能。如果只是“混日子”，他们什么也得不到。

    **给各位分析师的最终建议：**

    1. **界定问题：** 别只是“研究影响”。要与利益相关者（EDB、A*STAR、中小企业）合作，定义对各方而言什么是价值。
    2. **方法论：** 准备好使用严谨的经济分析（如QCA——定性比较分析）来应对像EDB这样看重硬数据的利益相关者，同时用故事打动其他人。
    3. **背景：** 不要一概而论。在不同背景下，成功的样子是不同的。

    下周，我们将探讨**技术情报理论**。理论性会比较强。谢谢大家。
## Week 4
  - [18:04 - 18:06] **Guest Lecturer Announcement & Networking Opportunities**

    And interestingly, on March 11th, we will have a guest lecturer volunteer to speak. In my class, I've never had this in the past. I approached him before, but I never had a chance to host him. He called me all of a sudden and said, "What about the guest lecture? You want me to give a lecture this year?" I said, "Why not?" Some of you might know him. Has anyone done a course under him? Okay. He has worked for multinational organizations and he has his own startup. So I asked him to give a lecture on foresighting, contrasting the two different sets—in MNCs and startups. So he will be here as well. He's taking up the time, and I have a lot to catch up with, but I didn't want you to miss out on these guest lectures because they are much more fun.

    It is a way of networking as well. I once had a friend who is a partner in Frost & Sullivan and Ernst & Young who used to come and give guest lectures here. And after the guest lecture is done, guess what? They will complain, "Oh, I got so many LinkedIn requests from these students." Okay, so it happens. These are good opportunities for you to know others and, you know, try to grow your network. That is also part of foresight and intelligence. So that would be on March 11th. I thought I'd go on with the lecture today. But help me in making this class a bit more interesting and me talking less, okay? Is that okay?

    有趣的是，3月11日我们会有一位客座讲师自愿来讲课。在我的课上，以前从来没有过这种情况。我过去联系过他，但一直没机会请到他。他突然给我打电话说：“客座讲座怎么样？你想让我今年来讲一课吗？”我说：“为什么不呢？”你们有些人可能认识他。有人上过他的课吗？好的。他在跨国公司工作过，也有自己的初创公司。所以我请他来讲关于预见（Foresighting）的内容，对比跨国公司和初创公司这两种不同环境下的情况。所以他也会来。虽然他占用了时间，我还有很多内容要赶，但我不想让你们错过这些客座讲座，因为它们更有趣。

    这也是一种建立人脉的方式。我曾经有个朋友是 Frost & Sullivan 和安永（Ernst & Young）的合伙人，过去常来这里做客座讲座。讲座结束后，你猜怎么着？他们会抱怨：“噢，我收到了这么多来自这些学生的 LinkedIn 好友申请。”好吧，这种事确实会发生。这些都是你们认识他人、拓展人脉的好机会。这也是预见和情报工作的一部分。所以那是3月11日的安排。我想今天我们就继续讲课。不过请帮个忙，让这堂课更有趣一点，让我少说点话，好吗？可以吗？

  - [18:06 - 18:07] **Lecture Introduction: Theoretical Models of Technology Intelligence**

    Alright, so today's topic is more on the process itself. Why we do it, I'll talk about it. In fact, that is part of the challenge for today. As always, we'll do a summary of last week and then we'll talk about the theoretical model of TI (Technology Intelligence), which talks about all these stages using a diagram, which I'll show soon. And I'll ask you: did you read those articles? Could you make heads or tails out of it? Yes and no? Okay, there is a reason behind it because you're not exposed to all the concepts. So after today's lecture, if you're going to read it again, you'll make better sense of it.

    But I gave you the article for you to understand that whatever we cover today is not just in books; it is indeed happening in real life. And all the case studies, in fact all the models that are derived, are out of case studies observing folks—how do they do foresighting and intelligence? And that's how the theory is formed. So that will give you a flavor for what things really happen all over the framework. Now, as far as the last two weeks are concerned, we looked at what is TI, why is it important, what are some of the challenges in doing it, and how can you make it work. That's what we looked at. We looked at, of course, AI Singapore and your case, both of which have to do with how do you assess the effectiveness of certain decision-making, mostly to help firms in being futuristic.

    好了，今天的话题更多是关于流程本身的。为什么我们要这样做，我会讲到。事实上，这也是今天挑战的一部分。像往常一样，我们会总结上周的内容，然后讨论技术情报（TI）的理论模型，它会用我稍后展示的一张图表来讲解所有这些阶段。我问一下：你们读那些文章了吗？能看懂吗？似懂非懂？好的，这是有原因的，因为你们还没有接触到所有的概念。所以在今天的讲座之后，如果你们再读一遍，就会更明白了。

    但我给你们文章是为了让你们明白，我们今天涵盖的内容不仅仅是在书本里，它确实发生在现实生活中。所有的案例研究，事实上所有推导出的模型，都是来自于对人们的观察案例——他们是如何做预见和情报的？理论就是这样形成的。所以这会让你们对框架下实际发生的事情有一种直观的感受。就过去两周而言，我们探讨了什么是技术情报，为什么它很重要，做这件事有哪些挑战，以及如何实现它。当然，我们也看了 AI Singapore 和你们的案例，这两者都与如何评估某些决策的有效性有关，主要是为了帮助公司面向未来。

  - [18:07 - 18:21] **Logbook Feedback: Evaluating Foresight Impact in Organizations**

    Now coming back to the logbook on what is foresight, why is it important, and what are some of the challenges in doing it. Actually, I thought of using your forum discussion from last week as an example of demonstrating what I expected you want. If you were to refer to that example or the question in the discussion forum, it's basically looking at capturing the impact of foresighting activities in your company. Short term, long term. And what are the measures used to capture the impact? Yes, and that's not it. There's something towards the end—suggestions. Yes, if there are any pitfalls, how can you mitigate them? How can you improve itself?

    Okay, so if you look at it, this is what I'm expecting in your logbook for the five topics that you're expected to cover. First, give a bit about the context for the company or whatever you are working on, and what is the TI activity that you are focusing on. Some students who do not have work experience try to basically spell out whatever was covered in that particular day's lecture. That's fine if you don't have work experience. You're not going to fail the module. So the basic average that you can take care of is at least reporting what was mentioned in the class correctly. Okay? And for those who have experience and want to ponder more about your experience, you don't have to necessarily cover what was covered in the lecture, but at least give a gist that you're going to talk about this particular topic so that I know what it is. And once you do that, give your context and the experience of TI or foresighting from that context. And if there are problems, how can you mitigate them? How can you improve it based on whatever you have learnt in class? And even after applying whatever you learned in class, if you think there are going to be problems and you have a way to mitigate it—that is going even beyond.

    Okay, Level 1 is just regurgitating whatever was mentioned in class. Level 2 is telling about your experience with foresighting, and if there were any challenges, what are they? Is there a way to mitigate them? The 4th one is: even after applying all this, you think there is still a problem and it requires some out-of-the-box thinking for which you have done your research and then try to address it. That is the highest level. Okay, so it is basically to differentiate the average from above average to the excellent ones. That's how the logbook is graded.

    Now, whatever you have done in the discussion forum is getting pretty good. Many of you mentioned about what is happening in your company and what are potential challenges and how you can overcome them. That is nice. And many of you mentioned about the KPIs being both short term and long term, and some of you even mentioned mid-term, which is nice. Typically there is short, mid, and long term as well. So that was covered by some. And then there are a few things I want to highlight in moving forward with the discussion forum—not with your logbook, but with the discussion forum. I want you to build on each other's ideas. Okay, again it is going back to my previous class. If I look at the discussion forum, it's like too many "me too" ideas. I don't want that to happen.

    **Chen Zhengdao**, you mentioned how in operational aspects—because intelligence also has to do with operational aspects—you were mentioning about how they are focusing on the short term and not the long term. This is one of the very practical challenges with all companies. They think operational people need not do intelligence, but that's not how it works. Even for operations, you need to be futuristic. For example, one of the projects which I recently was also part of a panel for, is from an **A\*STAR** student working on how warehouses can implement multifunctional robots. Typically, they have robots for warehouses, right? For lifting and then sending to a dock. But what happens is they have one specific robot for one purpose, so many times it's sitting idle when the second move is happening. So he was thinking about implementing this multifunctional robot which can handle multiple jobs if it's programmed. But for that to function well, even the software needs to be updated behind the scene and it is AI-based, learning-based as well. So when he posed this idea—why not implement this for a warehouse?—there was a big stigma happening in the warehousing. Why should we? Because it's not cheap. And what is the second challenge? One is, it's not cheap. Second one is... it exists, it's not that they are designing it, they are adopting it. But you're nearing the answer. What are the challenges with implementation? It's at a very embryonic stage of evolution. Now, if the technology is not mature and you want to go ahead and implement it, of course there'll be implementation challenges, how to program it, lots of challenges will be there. So the boss was thinking, does it really make sense? Should I invest in this? So you have to do a cost-benefit analysis and then you have to look at how long the impact will take for the warehouse to make me realize benefits. So he was thinking futuristic for his operational part. So even operations folks cannot look at only short term; they have to be futuristic as well. That is one point I want to emphasize.

    And **Li Jun**, yeah, so you shared about HR-related foresighting, which was very interesting. It's a very different perspective. I mean, unlike technology, product, and everything, she was looking at HR-related foresighting which is very, very practical. The KPIs are all measured about how fast you hire, whom you hired, etc. But what is the wrong on the corner of it? Are they sticking along? If they leave the organization, all the effort spent is going to waste. How did you balance the two aspects? In any case, I know you mentioned that they measure it, but how did they take care of incentives? So what—I don't know how many of you looked into it—but what she mentioned is, yeah, HR is hiring people, but if the work culture in the organization sucks, people leave. Now, can the incentive be tied to retaining people as well? To some extent they should, but are they fully responsible for the action? HR designed everything, also, that's what you think. But actually it doesn't happen that way, right? The projects are running the way they are run. So that is where the multifunctional aspects come into the picture.

    This is very similar to what **Karthik** has mentioned as well. They collect a lot of data from that side, but the data is only visible to middle managers. They are playing the role of intelligence gatekeepers. So we'll talk about it today. Well, if it's not even visible to the nurses, how are they going to act on it? Right, a very practical challenge. So this is where the visibility and communication and what we'll talk about—**Intelligence of an Organization** vs **Organizational Intelligence**—the whole thing is to do with the cultural structure, which is very much tied to what we are going to cover today. And Karthik also mentioned something similar, that it remains a "black box." Strategic thinking and vision, it's very similar. Moving forward, I want you to build on things like this. Of course, don't just mention short term, long term, KPIs and all, but start giving interesting twists. Because once you mention short term and long term, a couple of people say that it's obvious, right? Then subsequently in discussion forums, start building on the idea, saying: "You know short term and long term... How is it intertwined with different functions? And how has it to be made visible?"

    And there were two things which really stood out in terms of interesting context. One is from **Yi Jun**. Sorry. So he works in the security-related area. So in this, how do you measure foresight? It's always about what is *not* done. It's like—I work in pharma. When it comes to cancer, curing cancer is like, okay, whether the cells are killed or not. It's a binary disease. But in the case of Alzheimer's, that is very, very difficult because it's not like a binary decision; only you get to know after so many years that Alzheimer's is kicking in. And even after it kicks in, it's more about symptom addressing or mitigating rather than curing it. Okay, so your situation of security is like that. Foresighting is about when you do foresighting and act on it, people don't see it. So how do you assess the impact of it? That is where backtracking comes in—because if a calamity or disaster were to happen, then you can estimate the cost and what is the disaster and all everything. And you prevented it. How are you going to assess the impact? It's a very practical challenge.

    It's very similar to what **Meredith** shared earlier. It's about shutting down a project; in itself, that is foresighting. How much cost saving it is for an organization. So those are the aspects which are very, very interesting. And she also shared something on COVID-19, how entrepreneurial culture was nurtured. How it didn't kickstart, but still it started the wave. So when you do the discussion forum, if you want better marks, okay: don't think writing *something* will fetch you more marks moving forward. It's about how do you build on each other's ideas and give interesting angles to what idea has been thrown out rather than just "me too" kind of talk. Is that clear? So if you want to score well on the logbook and score well on the discussion forum, try to understand how it is. That way the number of threads become manageable. It becomes more enjoyable to read and learn. Any problems with that? And that will force you to think—have this higher-order thinking—that will help your logbook also. Right. Otherwise like, "Oh take this, put here," not going to work. Alright. I want to hear from those without experience. Are you still okay with it? Fine? Okay.

    现在回到关于什么是预见、为什么它很重要以及有哪些挑战的 Logbook 上来。其实，我想用你们上周的论坛讨论作为一个例子，来展示我期望你们做什么。如果你参考那个例子或者讨论论坛里的问题，基本上是在看如何捕捉公司中预见活动的影响。短期的，长期的。以及用什么衡量标准来捕捉这种影响？是的，不仅如此。最后还有一点——建议。是的，如果有任何陷阱，你如何规避它？你如何改进它本身？

    好的，所以如果你仔细看，这就是我对你们 Logbook 中要求涵盖的五个主题的期望。首先，介绍一下公司的背景或者你正在从事的工作，以及你关注的 TI（技术情报）活动是什么。一些没有工作经验的学生试图把当天讲座的内容基本复述一遍。如果你没有工作经验，这样做是可以的。你不会因此挂科。所以你能做的基本水平至少是正确地提到课堂上讲过的内容。好吗？对于那些有经验并且想更多思考自己经验的人，你不必一定要涵盖讲座中讲过的内容，但至少给出一个概要，说明你要谈论这个特定的话题，这样我就知道是什么了。一旦你这样做了，给出你的背景以及该背景下的 TI 或预见经验。如果有问题，你如何规避？基于你在课堂上学到的东西，你如何改进它？甚至在应用了所有课堂所学之后，如果你认为仍然存在问题，并且你有办法规避它——这就更进一步了。

    Level 1 只是复述课堂上提到的内容。Level 2 是讲述你的预见经验，如果有什么挑战，是什么？有没有办法规避？Level 4 是：即使应用了所有这些，你认为仍然存在问题，并且这需要一些跳出框框的思考，你对此进行了研究并尝试解决它。这是最高水平。好的，这基本上是为了区分普通、高于平均水平和优秀的学生。Logbook 就是这样评分的。

    你们在讨论论坛里做的已经很好了。你们很多人提到了自己公司发生的事情，潜在的挑战是什么，以及如何克服它们，这很好。很多人提到了短期和长期的 KPI，有些人甚至提到了中期，这很好。通常确实有短期、中期和长期之分。所以这部分有些人已经涵盖了。接下来我想强调几点，关于以后如何进行论坛讨论——不是 Logbook，而是讨论论坛。我希望你们在彼此的想法基础上进行构建。好的，这又回到了我之前的课。如果我看讨论论坛，有太多“我也一样（me too）”的想法。我不希望发生这种情况。

    **Chen Zhengdao**，你提到了在运营方面——因为情报也与运营方面有关——你提到他们如何关注短期而不是长期。这是所有公司面临的一个非常实际的挑战。他们认为运营人员不需要做情报，但事实并非如此。即使对于运营，你也需要面向未来。例如，我最近参与评审的一个项目，来自一位 **A\*STAR** 的学生，他研究仓库如何实施多功能机器人。通常，仓库里有机器人，对吧？用于举升然后送到码头。但问题是，他们有一种特定用途的机器人，所以很多时候当进行第二个动作时，它是闲置的。所以他在考虑实施这种多功能机器人，如果经过编程，它可以处理多项工作。但为了使其良好运行，甚至后台软件也需要更新，而且它是基于 AI 和学习的。所以当他提出这个想法时——为什么不在仓库实施这个？——在仓储领域有一个很大的顾虑。我们为什么要这样做？因为它不便宜。第二个挑战是什么？一个是不便宜。第二个是……它已经存在了，并不是他们在设计它，而是在采用它。但你已经接近答案了。实施的挑战是什么？它处于非常早期的演变阶段。如果技术还不成熟，你想推进并实施它，当然会有实施挑战，如何编程，会有很多挑战。所以老板在想，这真的有意义吗？我应该投资这个吗？所以你必须做成本效益分析，然后你必须看仓库需要多长时间才能让我意识到效益。所以他在为他的运营部分做面向未来的思考。所以即使是运营人员也不能只看短期，他们也必须面向未来。这是我想强调的一点。

    还有 **Li Jun**，是的，你分享了关于人力资源相关的预见，这非常有趣。这是一个非常不同的视角。我是说，不像技术、产品那些，她关注的是人力资源相关的预见，这是非常非常实际的。KPI 都是衡量你招聘多快，招了谁等等。但这背后的问题是什么？他们留下来了吗？如果他们离开组织，所有的努力都浪费了。你如何平衡这两个方面？无论如何，我知道你提到他们衡量它，但他们如何处理激励措施？所以——我不知道你们中有多少人研究过这个——但她提到的是，是的，HR 在招人，但如果组织的工作文化很烂，人们就会离开。现在，激励措施能不能也与留住人挂钩？在某种程度上应该，但他们对这个行为负全责吗？HR 设计了一切，你是这么想的。但实际上并非如此，对吧？项目是按既定方式运行的。所以这就是多功能方面发挥作用的地方。

    这与 **Karthik** 提到的非常相似。他们从那边收集了很多数据，但这些数据只有中层管理者可见。他们扮演着情报守门人的角色。所以我们要谈谈这个。如果护士甚至都看不见这些数据，她们怎么根据数据行动呢？对，一个非常实际的挑战。这就是可见性和沟通，以及我们要谈论的——**组织的智能（Intelligence of an Organization）** 与 **组织性智能（Organizational Intelligence）**——整件事都与文化结构有关，这与我们今天今天要讲的内容紧密相关。Karthik 也提到了类似的事情，它仍然是一个“黑匣子”。战略思维和愿景，这非常相似。展望未来，我希望你们在这样的事情上进行构建。当然，不要只提到短期、长期、KPI 之类的，而是开始给出有趣的转折。因为一旦你提到短期和长期，几个人会说这是显而易见的，对吧？然后在随后的讨论论坛中，开始在这个想法上构建，说：“你知道短期和长期……它是如何与不同职能交织在一起的？它如何变得可见？”

    还有两件事在有趣的背景方面真的很突出。一个是来自 **Yi Jun**。抱歉。他在安全相关领域工作。所以在这种情况下，你如何衡量预见？这总是关于什么 *没有* 被做。就像——我在制药行业工作。当谈到癌症时，治愈癌症就像是，好吧，细胞是否被杀死了。这是一种二元疾病。但在阿尔茨海默病的情况下，那是通过非常非常困难的，因为它不是二元决定；只有在很多年后你才知道阿尔茨海默病发作了。即使发作后，更多的是关于症状处理或缓解，而不是治愈它。好的，所以你的安全情况就是那样。预见是关于当你做预见并采取行动时，人们看不到它。所以你如何评估它的影响？这就是回溯发挥作用的地方——因为如果灾难发生了，你可以估算成本和灾难是什么等等。而你阻止了它。你打算如何评估影响？这是一个非常实际的挑战。

    这与 **Meredith** 早些时候分享的非常相似。它是关于关闭一个项目；这本身就是预见。这为组织节省了多少成本。所以这些方面是非常非常有趣的。她还分享了一些关于 COVID-19 的东西，创业文化是如何被培育的。它没有立即启动，但它仍然开启了浪潮。所以当你们做讨论论坛时，如果你想要更好的分数，好吗：不要以为写 *点什么* 就能在以后获得更多分数。关键在于你如何在彼此的想法上进行构建，并对抛出的想法给出有趣的角度，而不是仅仅是“我也一样”的那种谈话。清楚了吗？所以如果你想在 Logbook 和讨论论坛上得分高，试着理解这一点。这样线程的数量变得可控。阅读和学习变得更加愉快。对此有什么问题吗？这将迫使你们思考——拥有这种更高阶的思维——这也会对你们的 Logbook 有帮助。对。否则就像“噢拿这个，放这里”，是行不通的。好了。我想听听那些没有经验的人的意见。你们还好吗？行吗？好的。

  - [18:21 - 18:34] **Class Challenge: Starting Technology Intelligence from Scratch**

    Now coming back to the lecture, any questions so far? And whatever we covered, can we move on to today's topic? Okay, here's the challenge. And whoever can answer this need not write the logbook for the day. And whoever is able to answer this at the end of the class can get full marks for the discussion today—not the logbook waiver, but only because if you don't know, at least you listen and then try to answer at the end of the class.

    Now what is the challenge? You know what is foresighting. You know it is valuable, but you know it is challenging as well to do. But if you were to start intelligence and foresighting activities in your organization from scratch—imagine you are in a company wherein there's nothing being done and you want to start this intelligence and foresighting from scratch—how would you go about doing it? What steps would you take? Don't rush and take some time. For those who have seen through the lecture notes or read some articles, you might be able to answer somewhat. But for those who haven't, it's still okay, you can give it a shot.

    *Student:* Yeah actually I think personally for me I think incentives and benefits are one of the key important things when it comes to...

    *Professor:* Okay, incentives and approval from laws and buy-in from boss, okay, right. These are two things, okay?

    *Student:* I would actually set up a scout team, so...

    *Professor:* Okay, have some scouts and have under this... Okay. Think holistically. Okay. Yes.

    *Student:* I would say that one basic thing that I would introduce is a culture where, yes, there should be designated teams, but I would also encourage people to themselves do some form of knowledge sharing in the team. So cultivating or giving people time to explore beyond their current projects and looking at markets around them. Or political, social issues, how can it indirectly or directly affect the project that we are working on currently? And to do more knowledge sharing so that people can try to learn from each other and yeah.

    *Professor:* Okay, more like bottom-up. You'll be sharing and, as you do your work, you start exploring and then bring it out. That's the term—they call it passive. It's a dumb... you don't talk about it in my life, yes.

    *Student:* I think a...

    *Professor:* Okay. Though you said it's top-down, but the structure that you gave is... this is the closest that I've got to share. Good. Anything else?

    *Student:* What steps that I would take to make sure this works? I think I will self-analyze the company's boundaries and identify what the company does and what is in the internal boundaries of the company and what is beyond the boundaries. And analyze whether there's anything in the like narrow boundary that can be approached and can be identified. So I think the first step would be to self-analyze the organization itself and then realize what are the boundaries of the organization.

    *Professor:* This is right, but what to analyze and for what? That you're not clear.

    *Student:* One thing would be the, I mean, if you look at the technology aspects of the company, what are the technological...

    *Professor:* Are you referring to **Power Zone** again, like what she said?

    *Student:* Yeah, kind of, yeah.

    *Professor:* Yes and no, not exactly. Okay.

    *Student:* Yes, I think we will see from outside what's the competitors doing, what the industry is going to, and what's a new technology. And to match with our self-capability and working, when can we do step by step?

    *Professor:* That's very similar to the second step of **Kerr's** article. Look outside and then come inside. Okay, second step, yeah.

    *Student:* Also, maybe we can check the government's policy. If there is any opportunity for us to take to develop.

    *Professor:* Okay. And I'll take you and then come to you. Yeah.

    *Student (Sohail?):* I don't mean to say others are wrong. What you're saying is bits and pieces of it. But to give it a structure, better structure, I think these two folks did better. You were okay, but you didn't hit the... I don't know if this is like just going off of what you said just now. Is it the six steps that you are trying to get at? Like the coordinate, search, filter, analyze, document, assembly thing?

    *Professor:* But that's not what I was going to say.

    *Student (Karishma):* More of like after you've done that. What I kind of noticed in the organization was that they have the technology part of the intelligence and the market part of the intelligence like in the article. And there's also the competitiveness, like all these things are collected but only merged at the top level and it doesn't really help everyone in the next few levels if after that it has to keep disseminating down. So integrating—for example, let's say you know what technology that is, but how does that make sense with what you're learning about your customer needs or like the adoption patterns?—would be one of the key steps that I would want in between in the analysis part of the intelligence process. So like trying to bring the integration from the start because... when my startup, they collected both sides and then the data scientists and the AI engineers were like, "Okay, let's now sit in a separate meeting and then talk about it, and then we'll analyze this again." So in between the analysis done this from the start which is integration.

    *Professor:* Good point but... while it's one of the key steps.

    *Student:* I feel to initiate you have to first... one, there's an alignment, it could either be set up from the top, but I think it's also important that there's a culture that whatever it's being scouted or whatever can be communicated to the top. So I think a lot of times my company at least there's intelligence going on, of course, I think going on, but people don't understand that that's what they're doing. And at the top also they don't understand that. The decisions making, I think someone said "black box" as well. So I think there should be an alignment of "Okay, this is what everyone will be doing from now on within the company. This is what your roles would be. This is what you're doing is actually scouting or what you're actually doing this is..." and you know, whatever information, there's no boundaries you can communicate to management or whatever.

    *Professor:* Good alignment is important and you... you're giving again important parts of it, but I'm not getting the holistic part of it, okay. People don't want to stop trying, right? Okay, **Karthik**. We'll take just two more and then we'll end here just to give it a chance.

    *Student (Karthik):* I mean this is covered in the earlier lectures lah. So in the start, at the start I think it's very important to gather the stakeholders that are involved and then we have a like a whole meeting on like where the direction is gonna be and like umm the horizon—how many years are we talking about, what is the focus—so that everyone is on the same page. Again building on the rest that have shared. Then after that also need to define on perhaps the methodology or... and then after that then comes with the incentives and so that everyone is on the same page.

    现在回到讲座，到目前为止有什么问题吗？关于我们涵盖的内容，我们可以继续今天的话题了吗？好的，这是一个挑战。谁能回答这个问题，今天就不需要写 Logbook 了。谁能在下课时回答这个问题，今天的讨论就可以得满分——不是 Logbook 豁免，而是如果你现在不知道，至少你听了，然后在下课时尝试回答。

    现在的挑战是什么？你知道什么是预见。你知道它很有价值，但也知道做起来很有挑战性。但是，如果你要在你的组织中从头开始开展情报和预见活动——想象一下你身处一家什么都没做的公司，你想从头开始建立这种情报和预见——你会怎么做？你会采取什么步骤？不要着急，花点时间思考。对于那些看过讲义或读过一些文章的人，你们可能能回答出一部分。但对于那些没看过的，也没关系，你们可以试一试。

    *学生：* 是的，其实我个人认为，说到这个，激励和福利是关键重要的事情之一……

    *教授：* 好的，激励，以及法律的批准和老板的认可（Buy-in），好的，对。这是两件事，好吗？

    *学生：* 我实际上会建立一个侦察团队，所以……

    *教授：* 好的，有一些侦察员，并在下面设……好的。从整体上思考。好的。是的。

    *学生：* 我会说，我会引入的一件基本的事情是一种文化，是的，应该有指定的团队，但我也会鼓励人们自己在团队中做某种形式的知识共享。所以培养或给人们时间去探索他们当前项目以外的东西，看看周围的市场。或者政治、社会问题，它如何间接或直接影响我们目前正在做的项目？并做更多的知识共享，这样人们可以尝试互相学习，是的。

    *教授：* 好的，更像是自下而上的。你会分享，当你做你的工作时，你开始探索，然后把它带出来。就是这个术语——他们称之为被动式。这是个哑巴……你在我的生活中不谈论它，是的。

    *学生：* 我觉得……

    *教授：* 好的。虽然你说是自上而下的，但你给出的结构是……这是我目前得到的最近似的分享。很好。还有别的吗？

    *学生：* 我会采取什么步骤来确保这行得通？我想我会自我分析公司的边界，确定公司做什么，什么是公司内部边界内的，什么是边界之外的。并分析是否有任何在狭窄边界内的东西可以接触和识别。所以我认为第一步是自我分析组织本身，然后意识到组织的边界是什么。

    *教授：* 这没错，但分析什么以及为了什么？这点你不清楚。

    *学生：* 一件事可能是，我是说，如果你看公司的技术方面，什么是技术的……

    *教授：* 你又是指 **Power Zone** 吗，像她刚才说的那样？

    *学生：* 是的，有点像，是的。

    *教授：* 是又不是，不完全是。好的。

    *学生：* 是的，我想我们会从外部看竞争对手在做什么，行业将走向何方，以及什么是新技术。并将之与我们的自我能力和工作相匹配，我们何时可以一步步做？

    *教授：* 这与 **Kerr** 文章的第二步非常相似。向外看，然后回到内部。好的，第二步，是的。

    *学生：* 另外，也许我们可以检查政府的政策。是否有任何机会让我们去发展。

    *教授：* 好的。我会点你，然后到你。是的。

    *学生（Sohail?）：* 我不是说别人错了。你们说的是其中的零碎部分。但要给它一个结构，更好的结构，我认为这两位做得更好。你还行，但你没有击中……我不知道这是不是就像接着你刚才说的那样。是你想要得到的六个步骤吗？比如协调、搜索、过滤、分析、文档、组合这些？

    *教授：* 但那不是我要说的。

    *学生（Karishma）：* 更像是在你做完那个之后。我在组织中注意到的是，他们有情报的技术部分和情报的市场部分，就像文章里说的那样。还有竞争性，比如所有这些东西都被收集起来，但只在顶层合并，如果之后必须不断向下传播，这真的对下面几个层级的人没有帮助。所以整合——例如，假设你知道那是什么技术，但这如何与你了解到的客户需求或采用模式相匹配？——这将是我希望在情报过程的分析部分中间的关键步骤之一。所以就像试图从一开始就带来整合，因为……在我的初创公司，他们收集了双方的信息，然后数据科学家和 AI 工程师就像，“好的，现在让我们在一个单独的会议上坐下来谈谈，然后再分析这个。”所以在分析之间，从一开始就做这个整合。

    *教授：* 好观点，但是……虽然那是关键步骤之一。

    *学生：* 我觉得要启动，你必须首先……第一，要有一个对齐（Alignment），它可以是从上层设定的，但我认为同样重要的是有一种文化，即无论侦察到什么都可以传达给上层。所以我认为很多时候，至少在我的公司，情报工作正在进行，当然，我认为正在进行，但人们不明白那是他们在做的事情。在上层，他们也不明白。决策制定，我想有人也说了“黑匣子”。所以我认为应该有一个对齐，即“好的，这就是大家从现在开始在公司内要做的事情。这是你们的角色。这是你们正在做的实际上是侦察，或者你们实际上在做的是这个……”而且你知道，无论什么信息，没有边界，你可以传达给管理层或什么的。

    *教授：* 良好的对齐很重要，你……你再次给出了其中的重要部分，但我没有得到整体的部分，好的。大家都不想停止尝试，对吧？好的，**Karthik**。我们再听两个，然后就在这里结束，只是为了给个机会。

    *学生（Karthik）：* 我是说这在之前的讲座里涵盖了啦。所以在开始，在开始时我认为聚集涉及的利益相关者非常重要，然后我们开一个像全体会议一样的会，讨论方向在哪里，比如嗯，时间范围——我们在谈论多少年，重点是什么——这样每个人都在同一页上。再次建立在其他人分享的基础上。然后在那之后也需要定义方法论或者……然后在那之后才是激励措施，这样每个人都在同一页上。

  - [18:34 - 18:41] **The Theoretical Framework: Designing, Directing, and Developing**

    So I'm not giving it to you. I'll give it to this time, okay? So Channel not for Meredith, okay? The important thing is... many of you talked about what is going on here. Intelligence means like what Karishma said, right? You go and search, you filter, you analyze, and some of you said, "Oh no, there should be alignment with what the top-down is looking for," etc., etc. And "Otherwise, there is no integration. It doesn't work." All that is done is important, but this is the actual activity happening. Point temperatures.

    But if you were to start, it is very similar to... I like this example from one of the professors who used to say on why you need to... why should you know theory? Many students hate theories, right? They want very experienced skill-based [knowledge]. Why do we learn even theories? Why try? All academics try hard to look at cases and try to drop theory from it. For what purpose? They don't have any better jobs? What's the purpose of theory?

    It's like, you know, the excellent example given is: all you said is spot on correct. But they are like... if you take... if there is something you're driving, if there is something wrong in a car, right, you would go to a mechanic shop, a technician. He knows what went wrong and he'll fix the car and then you can drive it, right. But if you were to ask the mechanic to design a car from scratch, will he be able to do it? Not all will be able to do it. Okay, so for that it [requires] proper foundational degree building. That's why theory is very important. So all your answers are correct. But if you were to start intelligence and foresighting activities in an organization, there's a way to go about doing it, which is similar because she comes from the public sector, she has the broader [view], we should do it.

    So the way it works is... that's where the theory comes in. You have the systemic and systematic way to understand TI system which comprises of... This is the actual process: formulation of what we want. You understand your power zones, you look at outside industry where technology is going, you collect information, analyze it, and then finally you make decisions based on it. This is what is the important step I don't... but for it to function well, you need something above it, which is **TI Management**. What's the mission and goal? How do you structure the whole activity and what are the tools? Some of you said, right? "Oh my God, what methodology might work?" All these things need to be known. So like what Sohail said, right, first comes the **TI Management**, which is all about **Designing, Directing, and Developing**.

    What's in there? So if I'm working for a company, first I need to... what is **Designing**? Creating a theoretical model which reflects a "yet to be constructed reality." Which means if I were to start foresighting or intelligence activity for my company, what form should it take? For that, you need to understand what industry you're operating in. What is the culture of the company? Is it top-down driven or bottom-up driven? Are they in the forefront of innovation or not? Are they followers? But you move down... you had the bigger picture, but you move down immediately. It's very similar to top-down vision. Once you have that, now designing done. Okay. For my organization, given its hierarchical nature, probably a TI and you know, an **Intelligence of the Organization** is better a top-down approach wherein the boss says, you know, gives that question, throws it in, the analyst just collects the data and gives it and decision making happens at the high level. Is that part... that is the designing part.

    Then comes **Directing** wherein you Orient your system so that it fulfills the mission. You understand what is the mission. You need to ensure that top gives the right question to the analyst. You hire analysts, you have proper people designated to it. Give them tools, give them resources. Convince your boss to allocate resources. So directing happens there.

    And one part which Meredith did not say is that probably it doesn't happen. It happens, but the government organizations don't do it. Higher education institutions... once you have conceptualized, once you have directed it, it will function. But it need not always function correctly. Something could go wrong and it requires improvement. So as a person initiating the Intelligence or Foresighting, you need to go and continuously improve. Right, someone said knowledge management. Yes, it is important. Who said knowledge management? That's it, Knowledge sharing, someone here, right? Yeah. So knowledge management is important, but even when knowledge management is implemented, there is a person constantly studying the knowledge management systems to see if it's working well or not. I'll cover in the Knowledge Management class—if you're not constantly developing it, it will fail big time. So there is a need for the person who's orchestrating the whole thing to Design, Direct, and not only that, constantly monitor to upgrade it. That is **Developing**.

    Okay, and what is Design, Directing, and Developing is all about understanding your industry, organization, what culture works. Am I going to organize? What structure is it going to take? Is it going to be bottom-up or top-down? Do we have the necessary culture like that? If not, put that culture in place. Everything has to be done by this person. Now, this happens in again, you know, organizations which take foresight and intelligence very seriously. It's not shown to outsiders. Someone said—Karthik mentioned about "black box." Yes, it's kept as a black box because they don't want all the information to be available to every employee because they can easily replicate in our organization. That's why it's kept as a black box. Now for this you need somebody who is capable of doing. Is that clear?

    所以我没有给你们答案。我这次给，好吗？所以 Meredith 没拿到分，好吗？重要的事情是……你们很多人谈到了这里发生了什么。“情报”意味着像 Karishma 说的，对吧？你去搜索，你过滤，你分析，你们有些人说，“噢不，应该与自上而下的需求保持一致，”等等等等。而且“否则，就没有整合。它行不通。”所有这些都很重要，但这是实际发生的活动。关键温度。

    但是如果你要开始，这非常类似于……我喜欢一位教授的这个例子，他过去常说你为什么需要……为什么你应该知道理论？很多学生讨厌理论，对吧？他们想要非常有经验的技能型知识。我们为什么要学理论？为什么要尝试？所有的学者都努力看案例，并试图从中提炼理论。为了什么目的？他们没有更好的工作吗？理论的目的是什么？

    这就像，你知道，给出的那个绝佳例子是：你们说的全都完全正确。但它们就像……如果你拿……如果你在开车，如果车子出了毛病，对吧，你会去修车店，找技师。他知道哪里出了问题，他会修好车，然后你就可以开了，对吧。但是如果你让技师从头设计一辆车，他能做到吗？不是所有人都能做到。好的，所以为此需要适当的基础学位建设。这就是为什么理论非常重要。所以你们所有的答案都是正确的。但是如果你要在组织中开始情报和预见活动，有一种方法可以做到，这是相似的，因为她来自公共部门，她有更广阔的视野，我们应该这样做。

    所以它的工作方式是……这就是理论发挥作用的地方。你有系统性和体系化的方式来理解 TI 系统，它包括……这是实际的过程：制定我们想要什么。你了解你的权力区域（Power Zones），你观察外部行业技术的发展方向，你收集信息，分析它，最后基于此做出决策。这是重要的一步，我不……但为了让它运作良好，你需要在这个之上的东西，那就是 **TI 管理（TI Management）**。使命和目标是什么？你如何构建整个活动，工具有哪些？你们有些人说了，对吧？“天哪，什么方法论可能有效？”所有这些事情都需要知道。所以像 Sohail 说的，对吧，首先是 **TI 管理**，这全是关于 **设计（Designing）、指导（Directing）和发展（Developing）**。

    里面有什么？如果我在为一家公司工作，首先我需要……什么是 **设计**？创建一个反映“尚未构建的现实”的理论模型。这意味着如果我要为我的公司开始预见或情报活动，它应该采取什么形式？为此，你需要了解你在什么行业运营。公司的文化是什么？是自上而下的还是自下而上的？他们是否处于创新的前沿？他们是追随者吗？但你往下移……你有了大局，但你立刻往下移。这非常类似于自上而下的愿景。一旦你有了那个，好了，设计完成。好的。对于我的组织，鉴于其等级性质，可能 TI 和你知道的，**组织的智能（Intelligence of the Organization）** 最好是自上而下的方法，老板说，你知道，给出那个问题，抛进去，分析师只是收集数据并给出结果，决策发生在高层。那是那部分……那就是设计部分。

    然后是 **指导**，你需要以此为导向调整你的系统，以便它履行使命。你理解使命是什么。你需要确保高层给分析师正确的问题。你雇佣分析师，你有适当的人员指定去做。给他们工具，给他们资源。说服你的老板分配资源。所以指导发生在那里。

    Meredith 没有提到的一部分是，可能它不会发生。它发生了，但政府组织不这样做。高等教育机构……一旦你概念化了，一旦你指导了它，它就会运作。但它不一定总是正确运作。可能会出问题，需要改进。所以作为发起情报或预见的人，你需要去不断改进。对，有人说知识管理。是的，这很重要。谁说的知识管理？就是那个，知识共享，这里有人说的，对吧？是的。所以知识管理很重要，但即使实施了知识管理，也需要有人不断研究知识管理系统，看看它是否运行良好。我会在知识管理课上讲——如果你不不断发展它，它将会惨败。所以需要有人来协调整个事情，去设计、指导，不仅如此，还要不断监控以升级它。这就是 **发展**。

    好的，设计、指导和发展全是关于了解你的行业、组织、什么文化有效。我要组织吗？它将采取什么结构？是自下而上还是自上而下？我们要有那样必要的文化吗？如果没有，就把那种文化建立起来。一切都必须由这个人来做。现在，这再次发生在，你知道，那些非常认真对待预见和情报的组织里。它不向外人展示。有人说——Karthik 提到了“黑匣子”。是的，它作为一个黑匣子被保留，因为他们不想让所有的信息对每个员工都可用，因为他们可以在我们的组织中轻易复制。这就是为什么它被保留为黑匣子。现在为此你需要有能力做这件事的人。清楚了吗？

  - [18:41 - 19:02] **Debate: Intelligence of the Organization vs. Organizational Intelligence**

    This is the first step. And it requires the next step, that is TI management happening. The person who takes charge, he needs to understand, and everyone needs to understand the mission and goals of TI. And what are they? As I mentioned earlier. Many of you mentioned this, right? Yeah, Karishma mentioned this analyst was working on something. It wasn't integrated with the decision maker. There was a big gap. Quite a few mentioned that.

    So what happens is whether it's top-down or bottom-up, it doesn't matter. You need to understand TI as an activity conducted by a set of agents or can be viewed as a product with customers. Who are the customers in for TI? Decision makers are the customers. And who is the person making the product here? Analysts, okay. So it's something like there are two customers, two people here, two stakeholders here in TI: one is the **Intelligence Consumer** who are decision makers, other one is **Intelligence Broker**, who are typically the analysts.

    And intelligence can happen both ways in a company. Either it's top-down or bottom-up. What does top-down mean? The decision makers will tell you: "You know what I want to know about answers to these?" They will formulate the question and throw to you. "What is the next technology that I need to implement in NUS?" **Karthik** is asking those questions because he's directing a data... I want to... But what about this? You and I do the job and we tell the Proctor, "Maybe you want to know this because here is AI coming and we use the other organization like this. Maybe do this," okay, and he will decide ultimately. But it's your job to push it up.

    But culture is very important and you also pointed out because why this happens and it doesn't get pushed up. It gets lost especially by middle managers. You will read an article where it shows middle managers are the culprit many a times with the information not going up. For that to function well, you need to have certain culture within the organization, which we'll see later. Okay, so it can be either bottom-up or top-down. Bottom-up meaning: "What do we need to know? Why do we need to know? Decision is to be made once we know it," so you're pushing that information back to the decision makers.

    Either way it's bottom-up or top-down. You need to understand okay this is where I want to deliberate on if it is top-down driven. Which means the decision maker says "This is a question" and he gives it to Kai and says "Go analyze and give me the data, present the findings to me because I need to make decision." Then he becomes the **Intelligence of the Organization**. Right. That is why it's called Intelligence of the Organization. Karthik is now the Intelligence of the Organization because management explicitly formulates intelligence needs that they need to act on. They push it, they collect the data, analyze and then give the findings to the boss.

    But on the other hand, like some of you said, if it's going to be bottom-up, which means the whole organization acts like **Organizational Intelligence**, which means what? As I do my job, I stumble upon certain things, I pick up the scope like he said. I am the scout. I gather the information, then if I see it's pressing, I pass it on. So everyone, the whole organization, becomes intelligence analyst.

    Now which approach is good? Did you say anything? Good answer. Let's deliberate it a bit, okay? Instead of one-on-one, let's have a debate in this class, okay. Half of this class is going to say... Let's put exactly here. You learn your name is... Count 10 and then the one behind this is half class, okay. And this is other half class. So this class is going to tell why **Intelligence of the Organization** is good and this class has two different... why is better for the whole organization to be intelligent (**Organizational Intelligence**)? Okay. And don't repeat the points again. Because your class participation may be changing, has told you it is the number of times you speak matters. For me, it doesn't matter, okay? So add on value. Someone is saying a point, you negate it and substantiate with your argument. Okay, so let's start now. Let's start from here. Why do you think Intelligence of the Organization (Top-Down) is good?

    *Student:* Yeah. I think the reading mentioned as well that sometimes the bottom people would just... there's just a vast amount of information, they don't know what's important. By being top-down, you give a directive to the people who are like... you're giving them scope of what to look for. Maybe you have a limited resources, limited people, so you can scope down and target what is more important to your strategy, your company more. Yeah, because the information out there is vast.

    *Professor:* Right. You don't want to waste your resources, time, so I give top-down direction, yes. Any way to mitigate it, this side?

    *Student:* Yes, we do. 'Cause he was full of often you can expand your perspective from more people in your company and to encourage your people to be more proactive to contribute your value to the company and work for the boss the way you should.

    *Professor:* Good point but the way it's a debate, right? Very myopic, right? So it's one man show rather, if more people participate, there is diverse perspective. That is why you need to argue. Okay you develop your debating skills. Okay any... yes.

    *Student:* 'Cause they can see in the process point of view, so we can have a more systematic way to see how to improve.

    *Professor:* No. How would you improve? Your point is well taken. How would you improve? Improvise to attack her. Come on guys. You can demonstrate it's like me, you belong to where this... this side you have to build on a point, okay? Against her using her point. Yeah, frame it properly. Yeah, yeah, your point.

    *Student:* The size is very large the management... the management of all sorts of info...

    *Professor:* Ideas, that was ideas are good, but it leads to... yeah, what kind of thing is saying conflict? Yeah.

    *Student:* Too many conflicts. It's going to be very chaotic.

    *Professor:* Right, and some will say, "Oh, my idea wasn't taken," and there will be, you know, lots of problems in the organization. Good. You need to speak up, not action. Point well taken. Yeah. How are you going to guess **Karishma**?

    *Student (Karishma):* Yes, there is possibility of chaos, but I think just because there's a lot of information, it won't always necessarily lead to all of that information just sitting there and being a lot of noise. I think as it gets more exploration—because when you have top-down, it would possibly just go back to the previous points of confirmation bias because they're acting on what they know and existing business models—but because there's more information for them to act on their understanding and strategy afterwards, it will give rise to more scenario-based thinking or like multiple interpretations. So I don't think it will just... there will be chaos because there's a lot of information. As there's a lot of information and everyone is contributing to it more, overlaps can arise, and when that overlap arises, they can realize what are the more pressing problems because of all this information. It could be reframed better.

    *Professor:* Again, your point is not taken again. So you should say: "Yes it's going to be chaotic, but if you have proper structure in place to leave out redundant information, to leave out noise but get valuable inputs out." How can you do it? It's a very valid point if there is too much noise. But still you can draw valuable information from bottom-up approach if you were smart with what? Two things. How do you feel? That's a question. What processes you have to filter the knowledge?

    *Student:* Setting goals.

    *Professor:* That's one of the things. It's called results-driven approach, acknowledgement. That's where knowledge management comes into picture. To remove filter information, especially, you know, separate valuables from noise, you need to have proper knowledge management practices. And one of the approaches is called results-driven approach, which I'll talk about.

    *Student:* Yeah, you can't say... like about that, could I ask a question? Is that then more about prioritization? It's just aside.

    *Professor:* You can, yeah. It's about ideas which are most streamlined.

    *Student:* So yeah it's accepted that when we have more people looking outwards will get more ideas. Because first we're wasting a lot of uh, uh, manpower or everyone is like, uh, spending time looking outwards. And then when all these info come in, in order to make it work, we will have to set up a certain form of structure or system in order to filter and extract or to prioritize. And therefore, uh, you probably end up with like, umm, setting up a office or a group of people to look into what is... what are the noises? What is good? So that to filter and then push it upwards again for the management to decide?

    *Professor:* Yeah, so it's the same as top-down the same. No eventually, yeah, yeah, so in the end you still end up... and the resources part very valid, right? So if you were to strategize if there's a lot of resources that is needed to set this up. Now we're looking at upfront costs, but once if this is set up already, you're talking about a long-term organizational transition to something even better, the **Organizational Intelligence**. Okay. In fact, I totally agree with you that... You'll become master being diplomatic now.

    *Student:* There's one thing which we should put first is that if we build something, everyone go the same way, it's the same direction. If everyone goes to different direction, it will be a mess. Like we are building a church. From the bottom up, everyone is the goal is we are building the church, not building the road. We're planting a tree or we're building a building. No, we're building the church. Everyone have the same goal, so which one is priority, which one is practice because there are so many directions that is talked on... no matter it's long term or short term. It should be talked up. What can we do for the everyone's energy, for we can contribute more, we have new ideas. That's also top-down ways to doing that, which is new products, incubation, maybe a lot of people, they have new ideas, they have a lot of good ideas. What the company organization should do is that they... activity to like the individual people that junior people to share what their idea how to make these things better and then the decision also top-down. They will decide which one will be the more better way, the best one. They will choose the best one to light it, we realized so it will be not a mess. So totally no matter is long term or short term, individual contribution or organization contributions all top-down. The decision is all top-down.

    *Professor:* You know there is a nice but there is a better way to attack it as well. Her point is...

    *Student (Erin):* Yes, Erin. Yeah, yeah. If you look at the whole process, we start from the "Why" where the stakeholder comes with a vision and ultimately, even if it's bottom-up, with all the diverse feedbacks, the decision makers are the one who needs to take the company forward. So, uh, the top-down should uh, initially they have a general vision of what they want to achieve in the future. But when they gather all these feedback, ultimately it also lies with the top makers.

    *Professor:* Which? More of a quick teach then. You are all very clever. You know Hitler's descendants looks like this God is awkward. It's a no I... Top-down has its advantages, right? But to attack a point, what is the point is about there are so many people, yeah, it takes time, but overtime if you were to build the structure in place right, it is helpful in the long run is what you say. It is helpful in the long run because I know there are so many ideas, etcetera, etcetera, but she's saying to orchestrate everything if you have a proper structure in place. Of course it's going to take time and effort. Top-down approach only including a structure, but once you put it in place, it's going to be fruitful for so many years. Okay, yeah, but then your counterattack will be what?

    *Student:* Probably that approach works for larger organizations but even in small organization... Eventually the other decision makers is even done.

    *Professor:* Then you what you have to say is yeah, all the structure every then your point can be: "Yeah, you have these diverse people going, being scoured and getting information and there is structure, everything, but when the information is fed to the boss, he is such a bad boss that he acts on whatever. He disregards everything." Then what? Everything goes waste. What you're saying is to anyway, it's top-down driven, right? He makes a decision, that's what you're saying.

    But there is one thing which you know, one thing which you didn't mention about the con with the other thing is if they were to be the intelligence, right? Can they really work like that? Does it happen? Why did he use that as counterattack? Yeah, it's good. But how do they manage their day-to-day work and become the intelligence analyst, right? How are they going to juggle? Good. All you're saying is good, but are they able? How many of you really do the job taking care of day-to-day stuff as well as being the intelligence officer? It's not easy to manage, that is why you need to have what?

    So what is the summary of all this debate? So they're just doing intelligence, not also doing work. Resource—one is intelligence, right? The incentive, right, even if it's bottom-up, you ensure that is why you know in R&D intensive sectors they give one day off to work on pet projects. Right. They give 20% time off. Why did they do that? Your job is to work like individual professor and in some companies they send you for conferences, trade shows. Why did they do that? For you to go and enjoy, you know, Vienna and come back? It's part of it. But you go attend, bring information back into the organization, right? So it can work, but they need to be proper culture and single structure in place for this to function. If it functions well with appropriate structure, that's the best part. Right, but it is easily said than done. That is why either approach might work, but it depends on the organization that you're looking at.

    That is why when I said **Designing** a TI system, of course, first understand your company. What are you? If you're like Harley-Davidson, right, of course they have the coolest bike. But you know how rigid the organizations like... I say you do. It's a kind of structure they've got over there. The bottom-up approach will not work. It is... it works for more entrepreneurial kind of companies and open to new ideas. Okay, so first you need to understand what kind of company mindset do I have and who's my boss? And do I have a culture wherein if I give free time to my employees, they do the job [instead of] free riding, right? My employees are highly motivated or not? Is my incentive structure taking care of it? A lot of things need to be assessed. That's why the person who is managing the whole thing needs to be aware of everything that is in the theoretical framework so that an appropriate system is designed. And one of the most important thing for the bottom-up to work, I think it's in the next slide as well. I'll show you, okay.

    这是第一步。并且它需要下一步，那就是 TI 管理的发生。负责的人，他需要理解，每个人都需要理解 TI 的使命和目标。它们是什么？正如我之前提到的。你们很多人提到了这个，对吧？是的，Karishma 提到这个分析师在做某事。它没有与决策者整合。有一个很大的差距。相当多的人提到了这一点。

    所以发生的情况是，不管是自上而下还是自下而上，这都不重要。你需要将 TI 理解为由一组代理人进行的活动，或者可以看作是带有客户的产品。TI 的客户是谁？决策者是客户。谁是这里制造产品的人？分析师，好的。所以这就像在 TI 中有两个客户，两个人，两个利益相关者：一个是 **情报消费者（Intelligence Consumer）**，即决策者；另一个是 **情报经纪人（Intelligence Broker）**，通常是分析师。

    情报在公司里可以通过两种方式发生。要么是自上而下，要么是自下而上。自上而下是什么意思？决策者会告诉你：“你知道我想知道这些问题的答案吗？”他们会制定问题并抛给你。“我需要在新加坡国立大学（NUS）实施的下一项技术是什么？” **Karthik** 问这些问题是因为他在指导一个数据……我想……但这又怎么样呢？你和我做这份工作，我们告诉考官（Proctor），“也许你想知道这个，因为 AI 来了，我们像这样使用其他组织。也许这样做，”好的，他最终会决定。但你的工作是把它推上去。

    但文化非常重要，你也指出了为什么这会发生以及为什么它没有被推上去。它经常在中层管理者那里丢失。你会读到一篇文章，其中显示中层管理者很多时候是信息不上达的罪魁祸首。为了让它运作良好，你需要在组织内有特定的文化，我们稍后会看到。好的，所以它可以是自下而上或自上而下。自下而上的意思是：“我们需要知道什么？为什么我们需要知道？一旦我们知道就要做决定，”所以你把那个信息推回给决策者。

    无论哪种方式，自下而上或自上而下。你需要理解，好的，这就是我要斟酌的地方，如果是自上而下驱动的。这意味着决策者说“这是一个问题”，他把它给 Kai 说“去分析并给我数据，向我展示发现，因为我需要做决定。”那么他就成了 **组织的智能（Intelligence of the Organization）**。对。这就是为什么它被称为组织的智能。Karthik 现在是组织的智能，因为管理层明确制定了他们需要采取行动的情报需求。他们推动它，他们收集数据，分析，然后把发现给老板。

    但另一方面，像你们有些人说的，如果是自下而上的，这意味着整个组织表现得像 **组织性智能（Organizational Intelligence）**，这意味着什么？当我做我的工作时，我偶然发现某些事情，我像他说的那样拿起范围。我是侦察员。我收集信息，然后如果我看到它很紧迫，我就把它传递下去。所以每个人，整个组织，都变成了情报分析师。

    现在哪种方法好？你说了什么吗？好答案。让我们稍微斟酌一下，好吗？与其一对一，不如我们在班上辩论一下，好吗。这个班的一半会说……我们正好分在这里。你的名字是……数10个，然后这后面的是半个班，好的。这是另一半班。所以这个班要讲为什么 **组织的智能（自上而下）** 是好的，这个班有两个不同的……为什么整个组织变得智能（**组织性智能**）更好？好的。不要重复观点。因为你们的课堂参与可能会变，已经告诉过你们这取决于发言次数。对我来说，这不重要，好吗？所以要增加价值。有人说了一个观点，你否定它并用你的论点证实。好的，所以现在开始。让我们从这里开始。为什么你认为组织的智能是好的？

    *学生：* 是的。我认为阅读材料也提到，有时底层人员只是……信息量巨大，他们不知道什么是重要的。通过自上而下，你给那些人一个指令，比如……你给他们寻找的范围。也许你资源有限，人员有限，所以你可以缩小范围，针对对你的战略、你的公司更重要的事情。是的，因为外面的信息是巨大的。

    *教授：* 对。你不想浪费你的资源、时间，所以我给出自上而下的指示，是的。这方面有什么办法缓解吗？

    *学生：* 是的，我们有。因为他经常……你可以从公司里更多的人那里扩展你的视野，并鼓励你的人更主动地为公司贡献你的价值，并按你应该的方式为老板工作。

    *教授：* 好观点，但这是辩论，对吧？非常短视，对吧？所以它是独角戏，如果更多人参与，就会有多样的视角。这就是为什么你需要争论。好的，你们在培养辩论技巧。好的，任何……是的。

    *学生：* 因为他们可以从过程的角度看，所以我们可以有一个更系统的方式来看如何改进。

    *教授：* 不。你会如何改进？你的观点被接受了。你会如何改进？即兴发挥来攻击她。来吧伙计们。你可以演示，就像我，你属于……这边的，你必须在一个观点上构建，好吗？用她的观点反驳她。是的，恰当地构建它。是的，是的，你的观点。

    *学生：* 规模很大，管理层……对各种信息的管理……

    *教授：* 想法，那是想法是好的，但它导致……是的，那种说法是什么？冲突？是的。

    *学生：* 太多冲突。那会非常混乱。

    *教授：* 对，有些人会说，“噢，我的想法没被采纳，”会有，你知道，组织里会有很多问题。很好。你需要大声说出来，不是行动。观点很好。是的。你怎么猜，**Karishma**？

    *学生（Karishma）：* 是的，有可能混乱，但我认为仅仅因为有很多信息，并不一定总是导致所有信息只是坐在那里成为很多噪音。我认为随着它得到更多的探索——因为当你有自上而下时，它可能会回到之前的确认偏见点，因为他们基于他们所知道的和现有的商业模式行动——但因为有更多的信息让他们在之后的理解和战略上行动，这将引起更多的基于场景的思考或多重解释。所以我不认为它只会……会有混乱，因为有很多信息。因为有很多信息，每个人都贡献更多，可能会出现重叠，当这种重叠出现时，他们可以意识到因为所有这些信息，什么是更紧迫的问题。它可以被更好地重新构建。

    *教授：* 再一次，你的观点没有被完全接受。所以你应该说：“是的，这会是混乱的，但如果你有适当的结构来剔除多余的信息，剔除噪音但取出有价值的输入。”你如何做到这一点？如果噪音太大，这是一个非常有效的观点。但如果你聪明的话，你仍然可以从自下而上的方法中提取有价值的信息？两件事。你怎么感觉？那是个问题。你有什么过程来过滤知识？

    *学生：* 设定目标。

    *教授：* 那是其中之一。这被称为结果导向的方法，确认。那就是知识管理发挥作用的地方。为了去除过滤信息，特别是，你知道，将有价值的东西与噪音分开，你需要有适当的知识管理实践。其中一种方法被称为结果导向的方法，我会讲到。

    *学生：* 是的，你不能说……关于那个，我可以问个问题吗？那是不是更多关于优先级？只是题外话。

    *教授：* 你可以，是的。它是关于最精简的想法。

    *学生：* 所以是的，公认的是当我们有更多人向外看时会得到更多想法。因为首先我们在浪费大量的人力，或者每个人都在花时间向外看。然后当所有这些信息进来时，为了让它运作，我们将不得不建立某种形式的结构或系统来过滤和提取或确定优先级。因此，你最终可能会，嗯，设立一个办公室或一群人来研究什么是……什么是噪音？什么是好的？以便过滤然后再推上去让管理层决定？

    *教授：* 是的，所以这和自上而下是一样的。不，最终，是的，是的，所以最后你还是回到了……资源部分非常有效，对吧？所以如果你要制定战略，是否需要大量资源来建立这个。现在我们在看前期成本，可一旦这建立起来，你在谈论一个长期的组织转型，转向更好的东西，**组织性智能**。好的。事实上，我完全同意你的观点……你现在成了外交大师了。

    *学生：* 有一件事我们应该放在第一位，就是如果我们建立某个东西，每个人都走同样的路，那是同一个方向。如果每个人都走不同的方向，那将是一团糟。就像我们在建一座教堂。自下而上，每个人的目标是我们正在建教堂，而不是修路。我们在种树或我们在盖楼。不，我们在建教堂。每个人都有相同的目标，所以哪一个是优先事项，哪一个是实践，因为有太多的方向被谈论……无论是长期还是短期。它应该被讨论。我们可以为每个人的精力做什么，我们可以贡献更多，我们有新想法。这也是自上而下的做法，即新产品、孵化，也许很多人，他们有新想法，他们有很多好想法。公司组织应该做的是他们……活动去喜欢个人，初级人员分享他们的想法如何让这些事情变得更好，然后决定也是自上而下的。他们将决定哪一个将是更好的方式，最好的一个。他们会选择最好的一个来点亮它，我们意识到这样就不会是一团糟。所以完全不管是长期还是短期，个人贡献还是组织贡献，都是自上而下的。决定全是自上而下的。

    *教授：* 你知道有一个很好的，但也有一个更好的攻击方法。她的观点是……

    *学生（Erin）：* 是的，Erin。是的，是的。如果你看整个过程，我们从“为什么”开始，利益相关者带着愿景来，最终，即使是自下而上的，有着所有多样的反馈，决策者是需要带领公司前进的人。所以，呃，自上而下的应该呃，最初他们有一个关于他们未来想要实现什么的总体愿景。但当他们收集所有这些反馈时，最终这也在于最高决策者。

    *教授：* 哪一个？那就来个快速教学。你们都很聪明。你知道希特勒的后代看起来像这样，上帝很尴尬。这不，我……自上而下有它的优势，对吧？但是要攻击一个观点，观点是关于有这么多人，是的，这需要时间，但随着时间的推移，如果你能建立正确的结构，这就是你说的长期有帮助。长期有帮助是因为我知道有这么多想法，等等等等，但她说的是如果你有适当的结构来协调一切。当然这需要时间和努力。自上而下的方法只包括一个结构，但一旦你把它建立起来，它将在很多年里富有成效。好的，是的，但那时你的反击会是什么？

    *学生：* 可能那种方法适用于大型组织，但即使在小型组织中……最终其他决策者甚至都完成了。

    *教授：* 那么你必须说的是，是的，所有的结构……然后你的观点可以是：“是的，你有这些多样化的人去侦察并获取信息，有结构，一切都有，但当信息被喂给老板时，他是如此糟糕的一个老板，他随意行动。他无视一切。”那又怎样？一切都浪费了。你在说的是，无论如何，这是自上而下驱动的，对吧？他做决定，这是你在说的。

    但是有一件事你知道，有一件事你没有提到关于另一件事的缺点是，如果他们要成为情报人员，对吧？他们真的能那样工作吗？这会发生吗？为什么他用那个作为反击？是的，这很好。但他们如何管理他们的日常工作并成为情报分析师，对吧？他们如何兼顾？很好。你们说的都很好，但他们能做到吗？你们中有多少人真正做着照顾日常琐事的工作，同时又是情报官？这不容易管理，这就是为什么你需要有什么？

    所以这场辩论的总结是什么？所以他们只是做情报，而不做工作。资源——一个是情报，对吧？激励，对吧，即使是自下而上的，你确保这就是为什么你知道在研发密集型行业，他们给一天假来做宠物项目。对。他们给 20% 的时间。他们为什么那样做？你的工作是像个人教授一样工作，在一些公司，他们送你去参加会议、贸易展。他们为什么那样做？为了让你去享受，你知道，维也纳，然后回来？这是其中的一部分。但你去参加，把信息带回组织，对吧？所以它是行得通的，但需要有适当的文化和单一结构才能使其运作。如果它在适当的结构下运作良好，那是最好的部分。对，但这说起来容易做起来难。这就是为什么任何一种方法都可能有效，但这取决于你在看的组织。

    这就是为什么当我说 **设计** 一个 TI 系统时，当然，首先要了解你的公司。你是什么？如果你像哈雷戴维森，对吧，当然他们有最酷的摩托车。但你知道像……我说是你做的那些组织有多僵化。那是他们在那里拥有的一种结构。自下而上的方法行不通。它……它适用于更具创业精神、对新想法持开放态度的公司。好的，所以首先你需要了解我有什么样的公司心态，我的老板是谁？我是否有一种文化，如果我给员工自由时间，他们会做工作[而不是]搭便车，对吧？我的员工是否有很高的积极性？我的激励结构是否照顾到了这一点？很多事情需要评估。这就是为什么管理整件事的人需要了解理论框架中的一切，以便设计出适当的系统。而对于自下而上要起作用，最重要的事情之一，我想在下一张幻灯片里也有。我会给你们看，好的。

  - [19:02 - 19:12] **Data Sources: White, Grey, and Black Intelligence**

    Either way, right, it is top-down or bottom-up. They all will triangulate. Where do they triangulate? Because eventually the decision maker has to decide on strategic, tactical, operational decisions and the intelligence need that they look for—this **Who, What, Where, When, Why, How**? It could be about anything: technological, political, economic, right, market, competitive related, everything. Intelligence, why they need to act on identifying the opportunities and threats. That's a core of intelligence and foresighting anyway. For that, the intelligence agents are going to do these activities and look for information. They are going to look for data.

    Right. They either look for primary or secondary data. You know what is primary or secondary data, right? One is existing data or you gather data. Then internal, external—that is very obvious. **White, Grey and Black**. I think I already mentioned White, Grey and Black. **White** is information everything which is out in the public in the form of patents, publications and all. **Grey** is you collect by talking to experts, you ask them, "Hey, what's going to be the next technological wave," etc. And **Black** is... you illegally collect it. Do you illegally collect data even in government bodies? I will not record it. Say openly. Exactly, that's what I thought. Someone said something... what, you the security? I don't believe you. I'm pretty sure you collect a lot of black information. Anyone who wants to... I won't record the card. Anyone who really agrees to... "Yeah, my organization..."

    *Student:* Yeah, privacy, of course.

    *Professor:* You're government, right? Of course you have all data even about me. That is fine. That's not actually Black. Black is illegally... Yes, **Nisha**, what kind of data are you collecting?

    *Student (Nisha?):* I don't have confirmation that it exists, but it is suspected I think. There, how much can I say? I think they just maybe it's more...

    *Professor:* Yeah, I'll put a disclaimer here. She is not sharing about the company's name and she is talking about some other company. And it's also suspected. Suspected. You don't know if it's true or not. "I just heard somebody say this." Okay, now you share.

    *Student:* I think, I think there are probably—I don't know whether it goes in the Grey or Black more—where there's maybe a group of... a group of big businesses where they can discuss. Where information is known before it's released to public. You know what I mean? So it may be Grey, maybe Black.

    *Professor:* That's... that's still can be Grey. Yeah. You know why? Because that's how stock market works, right? I know many people make money in stocks because: "Oh, this person is working in the company. Is there anything happening? Okay, today I go and buy stocks with the company," right? That is still kind of... you can say it depends on how stupid the person is to share, to put his job at stake. Right? But I'll tell you one avenue through which black information easily passes out. Can anyone guess?

    Through your **suppliers**. Many a time suppliers fill information about two different customers. "Oh they are doing this. You know maybe you should also do this," with push in your own self-interest that skills. Okay, it's not supposed to happen, but it happens. That is one.

    Second thing I already told you: people, pharmaceutical companies diligently go and dig into the **trash cans** of other pharmaceutical companies, right? That happens for what? For what chemical formula they shred? They don't shred it properly. Go look for it, right? The other one is manipulating people and head hunting and this happens in tech companies—that is also one—and getting extracting all the information.

    Then there is one other thing. Okay, talking of Grey or Black, you don't know, right? There I, I think I mentioned this in biopharma industry, typically all... there can be certain star researchers or star scientists who are well sought after. So what happens is they keep traveling and if they are traveling to Asia, they will park themselves in a center hub like say in Tokyo or in Singapore. And then what happens is when they are there, all the companies in the region would book ticket and go and meet the person in the **transit hall** to gather information from there. Okay, so it's a confluence of ideas which happens, which gain from grey information gets collected because he's an expert and it feeds too many of the people and what they do with that is intelligence altogether. Okay, that also happens. Yes.

    *Student:* How about data? If I talk to my customer, a contract that I didn't win. I said, "May I know how much are they charging or bidding or what? What are they supplying that they could win the contract?" Is that so black?

    *Professor:* Yeah, supposed to be. You know, so that you're doing this in Singapore... So you're not supposed to share information, developing information. You're giving out information that's very, very dangerous.

    *Student:* How about in an interview? The interviewer asked the interviewee the questions about the organization of the candidates. Where they're coming from?

    *Professor:* Yeah, I ask how... what the strategy is about. This is very, very illegal, right? You're holding a person's job prospect at stake by leaking information. For the computer company, this is very much a random information. Right. Am I right? You shouldn't do... Yeah. But this person will of course tell why he or she wants a job. Right, yes.

    *Student:* Let me talk about the suppliers information. So I was I was kind of in the company where we just talked to suppliers about the competitors, you know. You know what they ordered or the size of it. For example the compressor. Like what kind of... what scale did it order or did it ask quotes? So they will tell us, but it's not Grey. It's not Black information because it's not classified, but we can guess the information... can get some information from the scale size of the compressor.

    *Professor:* Yes. Like what kind of business plan? Are the compressors something... Yeah, of course. I don't know why you don't transfer it as Black unless the product is already in the market, right? Of course, if it is in the market, you can reverse engineer and find it out, but before it enters the market. If you're asking for this information, definitely it is a Black. You're getting to know about your competitors. What are they working on, right? How efficient are they being compared to you? Isn't it? By regular supplier should not... If it is the core differentiating factor for the product, he will be very careful in not revealing it. But some suppliers do manipulate it for better bargaining power. Then it is of course Black information.

    So looks like half of this class should be jailed. Okay, anyway. So whatever bottom-up or top-down, eventually it all boils down to the same, just that what is the starting point that it was. That's all nice. And for the bottom-up to function well, if others are working on collecting data and then trying to push up, this has happened in many organizations, right? All the technologies that you see coming out...

    I don't know, **Adobe**, that I use regularly, even for my teaching, right? That comes out of **[Xerox]**, right? Why? Because these folks at the bottom they were working on clues and technologies, and they were trying to push the information up, asking for Xerox to consider the idea and make business out of it. But Xerox was so chaotic... very much centered, right? Very, very narrow in your vision that they did not give a damn to any of these ideas coming out of these engineers and scientists. And these people, they got frustrated and they left the organization. They started their own companies that became Adobe, that became Documentum, and that became many technology companies, which are giants now because of one company not being ignorant. So for the bottom-up to function there needs to be proper communication channel and culture of openness for it to work, otherwise it won't work.

    无论是哪种方式，对，自上而下还是自下而上。它们都会进行三角测量（Triangulate）。在哪里三角测量？因为最终决策者必须对战略、战术、运营决策以及他们寻找的情报需求做出决定——这个 **谁、什么、哪里、何时、为什么、如何（5W1H）**？它可以是关于任何事情的：技术、政治、经济，对，市场、竞争相关的，一切。情报，为什么他们需要采取行动识别机会和威胁。无论如何，这是情报和预见的核心。为此，情报代理人将进行这些活动并寻找信息。他们要寻找数据。

    对。他们要么寻找一手数据，要么寻找二手数据。你知道什么是一手或二手数据，对吧？一个是现有的数据，或者你收集的数据。然后是内部的、外部的——这非常明显。**白色、灰色和黑色**。我想我已经提到了白色、灰色和黑色。**白色** 是以专利、出版物等形式公开的所有信息。**灰色** 是你通过与专家交谈收集的，你问他们，“嘿，下一个技术浪潮会是什么，”等等。而 **黑色** 是……你非法收集的。即使在政府机构，你们也会非法收集数据吗？我不会录下来的。公开说。没错，我就是这么想的。有人说了什么……什么，你是做安全的？我不信你。我很确定你收集了很多黑色信息。任何想……我不会记录那张卡片。任何真正同意……“是的，我的组织……”

    *学生：* 是的，隐私，当然。

    *教授：* 你是政府部门的，对吧？当然你有所有数据，甚至关于我的。那没关系。那实际上不是黑色的。黑色是非法的……是的，**Nisha**，你在收集什么样的据？

    *学生（Nisha?）：* 我没有确认它存在，但我想是被怀疑的。在那里，我能说多少？我想他们只是也许更多是……

    *教授：* 是的，我会在这里放一个免责声明。她没有分享公司的名字，她在谈论其他公司。而且这也是被怀疑的。怀疑。你不知道是不是真的。“我只是听说有人这么说。”好的，现在你分享。

    *学生：* 我想，我想可能——我不知道这更多是属于灰色还是黑色——也许有一群……一群大企业，他们可以讨论。信息在向公众发布之前就被知晓了。你明白我的意思吗？所以这可能是灰色，也许是黑色。

    *教授：* 那……那仍然可以是灰色的。是的。你知道为什么吗？因为股市就是这样运作的，对吧？我知道很多人在股市赚钱是因为：“噢，这个人在那个公司工作。有什么事情发生吗？好的，今天我去买那个公司的股票，”对吧？这仍然有点……你可以说这取决于那个人有多蠢去分享，拿他的工作冒险。对吧？但我会告诉你们一个黑色信息容易泄露的渠道。谁能猜到？

    通过你的 **供应商**。很多时候，供应商会填写关于两个不同客户的信息。“噢，他们在做这个。你知道也许你也应该做这个，”带着为了自身利益的推动。好的，这本不该发生，但它发生了。这是一个。

    第二件事我已经告诉过你们：人们，制药公司勤奋地去挖其他制药公司的 **垃圾桶**，对吧？那发生是为了什么？为了他们切碎了什么化学配方？他们没有正确切碎。去找找看，对吧？另一个是操纵人员和猎头，这发生在科技公司——这也是一个——并获取提取所有信息。

    还有一件事。好的，说到灰色或黑色，你不知道，对吧？在那里我，我想我在生物制药行业提到过这个，通常所有的……可能会有某些明星研究员或明星科学家受到热捧。所以发生的情况是他们不停地旅行，如果他们去亚洲旅行，他们会把自己停在一个中心枢纽，比如东京或新加坡。然后发生的情况是，当他们在那里时，该地区的所有公司都会订票，去 **中转大厅** 见那个人，从那里收集信息。好的，所以这是一种思想的汇流，从中收集到的灰色信息，因为他是专家，它喂养了太多人，他们用它做的是完全的情报。好的，那也会发生。是的。

    *学生：* 数据怎么样？如果我跟我的客户谈一个我没赢下来的合同。我说，“我可以知道他们收费多少或报价多少或什么吗？他们提供了什么能赢下合同？”那是那么黑色的吗？

    *教授：* 是的，应该是。你知道，所以你在新加坡做这个……所以你不应该分享信息，开发信息。你在泄露非常非常危险的信息。

    *学生：* 面试中呢？面试官问面试者关于候选人组织的问题。他们从哪里来？

    *教授：* 是的，我问……战略是关于什么的。这是非常非常非法的，对吧？你通过泄露信息拿一个人的工作前景冒险。对于计算机公司来说，这非常像是随机信息。对。我是对的吗？你不应该做……是的。但这人当然会说为什么他或她想要一份工作。对，是的。

    *学生：* 让我谈谈供应商信息。所以我曾经在一家公司，我们只是和供应商谈论竞争对手，你知道。你知道他们订购了什么或者它的尺寸。例如压缩机。比如什么样的……它订购了什么规模或者它询价了吗？所以他们会告诉我们，但这不是灰色的。这不是黑色信息，因为它不是机密的，但我们可以猜测信息……可以从压缩机的规模尺寸得到一些信息。

    *教授：* 是的。比如什么样的商业计划？压缩机是不是什么……是的，当然。我不明白为什么你不把它归为黑色，除非产品已经在市场上了，对吧？当然，如果它在市场上，你可以逆向工程找出来，但在它进入市场之前。如果你在问这个信息，那绝对是黑色的。你在了解你的竞争对手。他们在做什么，对吧？比起你来他们效率如何？不是吗？正规供应商不应该……如果这是产品的核心差异化因素，他会非常小心不泄露它。但有些供应商为了更好的议价能力确实会操纵它。那当然是黑色信息。

    所以看起来这个班的一半人应该被抓起来。好的，不管怎样。所以无论自下而上还是自上而下，最终都归结为同一个，只是起点是什么。那都很好。为了让自下而上运作良好，如果其他人致力于收集数据然后试图向上推，这在很多组织中都发生过，对吧？你看到的所有涌现出来的技术……

    我不知道，**Adobe**，我经常用的，甚至为了教学也用，对吧？那是从 **[Xerox]** 出来的，对吧？为什么？因为底层的这些人他们在研究线索和技术，他们试图把信息推上去，要求 Xerox 考虑这个想法并将其商业化。但 Xerox 是如此混乱……非常中心化，对吧？你们的视野非常非常狭隘，以至于他们对这些工程师和科学家提出的任何想法都不屑一顾。这些人，他们感到沮丧，离开了组织。他们创办了自己的公司，变成了 Adobe，变成了 Documentum，变成了许多科技公司，它们现在是巨头，就因为一家公司并非无知。所以为了让自下而上发挥作用，需要有适当的沟通渠道和开放的文化才能行得通，否则它是行不通的。

  - [19:12 - 19:20] **Formulating Intelligence Questions: What Do We Need to Know?**

    Now the question... whether you are, your company is having a top-down driven approach or bottom-up approach—bottom-up approach either way—both stakeholders should either come up with a question or try to come up with some data and analysis and findings to answer a question, right? Because ultimately everyone has to answer a question. That is how decision can be made.

    Now, whether it's top... if it's top, easier. Because the boss knows where the company is going, maybe right or he may be wrong, but if he says, "Hey, go and tell me when this technology is going to hit the market. How long will it take for it to mature?" There is a clear-cut question. Then [for] U.S. intelligence analysts, easier for you to work on; you will start getting data about who is working on this technology, what is the patent like, how far it is, what is the TRL (Technology Readiness Level) like, etc. You will work on it. Right. If you're bottom-up, my information also you will look for information that can potentially answer certain questions, which is: "Compared to this technology, is this technology working superior?" Then you compare the performance, of course, then push it. You're the boss, right?

    Either way, the question is what makes a big difference either approach. That is why when you look at this process... though the process is the same, what is the gap? What is the need? What is the question that is being answered by intelligence mix up? Makes hell a lot of difference in whether your foresighting is working to your advantage or not. So that brings down to the point, what kind of questions would you... if you were one of the stakeholders, either the boss or the analysts... I already told you: "When will this technology mature?" That is one. Remember **Who, What, When, Why, How**? Are they defining things? What other questions can you come up with that are being futuristic? Yes.

    *Student:* In terms of regulated industries, for example, like banking, yes, because they can't always just jump on the new type, but I guess their version of TI would be: "Is the type like inevitable? Like do we have to conform to this very much? Do you think the policy would allow me to adopt this technology and implement it for my strategies advantage?"

    *Professor:* That's a very important question. The policy is not advancing enough keeping pace with the technology... no using you investing in it, right? That's what is happening many times. Know why the blockchain and everything is... so there's so much uncertainty surrounding it because... no, even though, you know, autonomous vehicles, so much of uncertainty because the policy is not there yet. Insurance policies and everything. It's not effective. Yes. What else?

    *Student:* Who else is doing this thing very good? Who else is betting on this technology? Or who is developing even the technology?

    *Professor:* Do I have confidence in that company? If it's a startup company, it goes bust, then what am I going to do? What else?

    *Student:* What is the delta which will be observable once...? In terms of savings?

    *Professor:* Good. What is going to be the benefit, right? Can you quantify it? Of adopting the technology? Yes.

    *Student:* How long does it take to implement?

    *Professor:* Very good. That's a very practical challenge. How long will it take? Can I keep losing money from my pocket until then? Until every benefits? Until I see through it? Yeah.

    *Student:* Does it have any risks?

    *Professor:* Risk assessment, okay.

    *Student:* How much we know about this new test, how much we know about it, how much it will cost, those are also important aspect. In fact, I if it's an IT company, the stakeholder from the headquarter will be asked like what technology will be popular in the future five years and who will be the winner in this technology and where we are, what our position, where we stand at the current time and how can we move up to the top, maybe top three or top one and when should we take something specific activities at some time to make sure that we move up? Will be the comprehensive set of questions for our company.

    *Professor:* Know what they know? That's one of the two-by-two graph. That's where knowledge management comes into picture. Yes, you know, you all said right about **Praveen Linga** and gas hydrates and all. At some point, of course we have good knowledge management system. At some point in NUS if external stakeholders are coming and asking "Hey I want to solve this problem," could be an energy sector or something, we would scramble to find who is expert in here, right, until we had proper knowledge management system in place. Okay, the moment you say this, I know **Praveen Linga** can do it, right? So that is all about knowledge management, yes.

    *Student:* How does it fit into our company? And then whether there's any additional things we need to do to get the company ready for it?

    *Professor:* Yeah, how would we fit in? How come nobody is talking about government and funds in spite of having one from security, one from government? Yeah, yes.

    *Student:* More of like, when is this the right time right now to be adopting this? Uh, particular to me...

    *Professor:* At times, the time is the killer. Is this the right time to adopt it? When is the time that I need to jump in? That's always a very tricky challenge. Yes.

    *Student:* There's any other company that you want to acquire the company or you want to wait, like you said, wait till the technology emerges or do you want to start investing right now? What decision do you want to make regarding?

    *Professor:* Very good. You know, all these are vital decisions. Oh no, you lost most of the important stuff. So back to you, gentlemen, right?

    *Student:* Does the government provide subsidy to support us in this?

    *Professor:* Who is giving me subsidy? Is there government grant? That is the first thing that we should always lookout. When you are looking at foresighting because you're betting on future which is very uncertain, you should tap into what is... How can I mitigate my... wasting wastage of resources. Who can I collapse? Who's going to find? That's what is happening big time in many sectors, especially when the when we come up with... know five year plan, all the companies are looking at... right. What is the... where is the money line now, right? All the sectors and then companies start working out. I put up the proposal what we should do.

    Yeah. So in the interest of time that let's move on. These are some of the set of questions that come out of... either top management or when you are an analyst you can ask. A few things that you missed out is related to **Intellectual Property** protection as well. What form of intellectual property protection relating to this technology should be pursued? This also makes a big difference depending on your industry if there is... IT protection is not working sometimes, okay. And market you can think about, you know that is why if you look at this graph... either way it's top-down driven or bottom-up, you basically ask this question Who, What, Then, Then Why? And you should talk about all the aspects of **Political, Economic, Social, Technical, Legal, and Environmental (PESTLE)**. Though they call activities as Market Competition and Technology, it doesn't confine there. It goes to broader socio-economic, environmental—more so for energy people. Okay, those coming from energy systems, the broader environment makes a picture.

    现在问题来了……不管你，你的公司是采用自上而下的方法还是自下而上的方法——自下而上的方法也是一样——利益相关者双方都应该要么提出一个问题，要么试图提出一些数据、分析和发现来回答一个问题，对吧？因为最终每个人都要回答一个问题。这样才能做出决策。

    现在，如果是自上而下……如果是自上而下，更容易。因为老板知道公司要去哪里，也许是对的，或者他可能是错的，但如果他说，“嘿，去告诉我这项技术什么时候会进入市场。它成熟需要多长时间？”这就是一个明确的问题。那么对于美国的分析师来说，这更容易开展工作；你会开始获取关于谁在研究这项技术、专利是什么样的、进展如何、TRL（技术就绪指数）是什么样的数据，等等。你会着手去做。对。如果你是自下而上的，我的信息也……你会寻找可能回答某些问题的信息，即：“与这项技术相比，这项技术的表现是否更优越？”当然，然后你比较性能，然后推送它。你是老板，对吧？

    无论哪种方式，问题是两种方法产生巨大差异的原因。这就是为什么当你看这个过程时……虽然过程是一样的，但差距是什么？需求是什么？情报混合回答的问题是什么？这对你的预见是否对你有利有着天壤之别。所以归根结底，你会提出什么样的问题……如果你是利益相关者之一，无论是老板还是分析师……我已经告诉过你：“这项技术什么时候成熟？”这是一个。记得 **谁、什么、何时、为什么、如何** 吗？它们在定义事物吗？你能提出哪些其他的面向未来的问题？是的。

    *学生：* 就受监管的行业而言，例如银行业，是的，因为他们不能总是直接跳上新型技术，但我猜他们的 TI 版本会是：“这种类型是不可避免的吗？就像我们必须非常顺应这个吗？你认为政策会允许我采用这项技术并为了我的战略优势实施它吗？”

    *教授：* 这是一个非常重要的问题。政策没有跟上技术的步伐……你去投资它是没用的，对吧？这很多时候都在发生。知道为什么区块链和所有东西……周围有那么多不确定性，因为……不，即使，你知道，自动驾驶汽车，有那么多不确定性，因为政策还没有到位。保险政策和一切。它还没有生效。是的。还有什么？

    *学生：* 还有谁这件事做得很好？还有谁在押注这项技术？或者甚至是谁在开发这项技术？

    *教授：* 我对那家公司有信心吗？如果是家初创公司，它倒闭了，那我该怎么办？还有什么？

    *学生：* 一旦……会有什么可观察到的增量（Delta）……？在节省方面？

    *教授：* 很好。好处会是什么，对吧？你能量化它吗？采用这项技术？是的。

    *学生：* 实施需要多长时间？

    *教授：* 很好。这是一个非常实际的挑战。需要多长时间？我能一直从口袋里亏钱直到那时候吗？直到所有的好处出现？直到我熬过去？是的。

    *学生：* 它有风险吗？

    *教授：* 风险评估，好的。

    *学生：* 我们对这个新测试了解多少，我们对它了解多少，它将花费多少，这些也是重要的方面。事实上，如果是 IT 公司，总部的利益相关者会被问到比如未来五年什么技术会流行，谁会是这项技术的赢家，我们在哪里，我们的位置，我们目前站在哪里，我们如何能升至顶端，也许前三或第一，我们应该何时采取某些特定活动以确保我们上升？这将是我们公司的综合问题集。

    *教授：* 知道他们知道什么？那是二乘二图表之一。那就是知识管理发挥作用的地方。是的，你知道，你们都说对了关于 **Praveen Linga** 和天然气水合物等等。在某一点上，当然我们有良好的知识管理系统。在 NUS 的某一点上，如果外部利益相关者来问“嘿，我想解决这个问题，”可能是能源部门什么的，我们会争先恐后地找谁是这里的专家，对吧，直到我们有了适当的知识管理系统。好的，你一说这个，我就知道 **Praveen Linga** 能做，对吧？所以那全是关于知识管理，是的。

    *学生：* 它如何适应我们要公司？然后是否有任何额外的事情我们需要做来让公司为此做好准备？

    *教授：* 是的，我们如何适应？怎么没人谈论政府和资金，尽管有一个来自安全部门，一个来自政府部门？是的，是的。

    *学生：* 更像是，现在采用这个的时机对吗？呃，对我个人而言……

    *教授：* 有时，时间是杀手。这是采用它的正确时机吗？我什么时候需要跳进去？这总是一个非常棘手的挑战。是的。

    *学生：* 有没有其他公司你想收购，或者你想等待，就像你说的，等到技术出现，还是你想现在就开始投资？你想做什么样的决定？

    *教授：* 很好。你知道，所有这些都是至关重要的决定。噢不，你错过了大部分重要的东西。所以回到你，先生们，对吧？

    *学生：* 政府是否提供补贴来支持我们做这个？

    *教授：* 谁在给我补贴？有政府拨款吗？那是我们做预见时应该总是留意的第一件事，因为你在押注未来，这是非常不确定的，你应该利用什么是……我如何减轻我的……浪费资源的浪费。我能拉谁入伙？谁会资助？这在很多行业都在大规模发生，尤其是当我们提出……知道五年计划时，所有的公司都在看……对。什么是……现在的钱路在哪里，对吧？所有的行业，然后公司开始运作。我提出我们应该做什么的建议。

    是的。所以为了节省时间，我们继续。这些是……要么是最高管理层，要么当你作为分析师时可以问的一组问题。你们错过的一些事情也与 **知识产权（IP）** 保护有关。应该追求什么形式的与该技术相关的知识产权保护？这也取决于你的行业，如果有……IT 保护有时不起作用，好的。市场你可以考虑，你知道这就是为什么如果你看这个图表……无论是自上而下还是自下而上，你基本上都在问这个问题：谁、什么、然后、然后为什么？你应该谈论 **政治、经济、社会、技术、法律和环境（PESTLE）** 的所有方面。虽然他们称活动为市场、竞争和技术，但它不仅限于此。它涉及更广泛的社会经济、环境——对于能源行业的人来说更是如此。好的，那些来自能源系统的人，更广泛的环境构成了一幅图景。

  - [19:21 - 19:25] **Case Study: India's AI Data Center Strategy**

    On that note, you might have seen the latest news. I don't know how many of you are catching up with India. The latest news is India is investing $100 billion in AI-related data centers. Then the whole world is moving away from data centers. Why? Why would you move away from data centers? How are saving? Conservation. Environmental, right. Nobody wants to own large data centers now, but India is investing $100 billion. Why? Right. There is always requirements here. If everyone comes down, maybe it's time for us to move up.

    *Student:* No, that's not the logic that they give. What is the logic that they give? Yes.

    *Professor:* Government strategy question. There is one interesting mission that they say, I don't know if it's all worth it. And those Indians, come on. Do you know why? Yeah. Why are... why is when the whole world isn't saying no, why is India investing in that data saying?

    *Student:* Renewable energy sources are ramping up, so that can mitigate. I don't know that part, but...

    *Professor:* What the government thinks is that if you look at data worldwide, 20% of the data comes from India. So they want to have protection on their data. So they think having the data centers there will give them the... they can kind of protect the data is what they think, and they have massively... Data is going to be the way the world goes. They didn't want to take it out as well, they say. But is it worth the investment? It's a... it's a foresight product on its own. A country betting on such a big initiative when there is power cut, when there is water shortage, when there is so much of environmental concerns. I'm pretty sure, you know, they would have done their due diligence and they made the decision, but what was it like the process? We don't know.

    But these are things which you need to watch out for, right? Not at the country level alone, because something at the national level becomes ended little bit more visible, because people talk about it, this increases here and there. So then you can map it out. What is the foresighting process like, what was the process that they underwent, etc. Okay.

    Now. There is one canvas, one tool which helps in framing the question. I don't write in thousands [of] article. The first thing was having a workshop and pulling out... Actually this particular workshop and framework or tool in in foresighting and intelligence, we always call this kind of thing as **Tool**. This tool can help in coming up with the right question. Which also eases the process of subsequent searching, filtering, analysis as well. So we look at this tool after a break. Okay, we'll take about 10 minutes break enough. Latest by 40 but try to be here by 35. Okay then we finish early we...

    关于这点，你们可能看到了最新的新闻。我不知道你们中有多少人在关注印度。最新的新闻是印度正在投资 1000 亿美元用于 AI 相关的数据中心。而全世界都在远离数据中心。为什么？为什么要远离数据中心？怎么节省？保护。环境，对。现在没人想拥有大型数据中心，但印度正在投资 1000 亿美元。为什么？对。这里总是有需求的。如果每个人都下来了，也许是我们上去的时候了。

    *学生：* 不，那不是他们给出的逻辑。他们给出的逻辑是什么？是的。

    *教授：* 政府战略问题。他们说有一个有趣的任务，我不知道这是否值得。而且那些印度人，拜托。你知道为什么吗？是的。为什么……为什么当全世界都在说不的时候，为什么印度在投资那个数据中心？

    *学生：* 可再生能源正在增加，所以这可以缓解。那部分我不知道，但是……

    *教授：* 政府的想法是，如果你看全世界的数据，20% 的数据来自印度。所以他们想要保护他们的数据。所以他们认为在那里拥有数据中心会给他们……他们可以某种程度上保护数据，这是他们的想法，而且他们有大量的……数据将是世界发展的方向。他们说，他们也不想把它拿出去。但这值得投资吗？这是……这本身就是一个预见产品。一个国家在停电、缺水、有这么多环境担忧的时候，押注于如此巨大的举措。我很确定，你知道，他们会做尽职调查并做出了决定，但过程是什么样的？我们不知道。

    但这些是你需要留意的事情，对吧？不仅仅是在国家层面，因为国家层面的事情最终变得更加可见一点，因为人们在谈论它，这里那里都在增加。那么你就可以把它描绘出来。预见过程是什么样的，他们经历了什么过程，等等。好的。

    现在。有一个画布，一个工具可以帮助构建问题。我不写成千上万的文章。第一件事是举办一个研讨会并拿出来……实际上这个特定的研讨会和框架或工具，在预见和情报中，我们总是称这种东西为 **工具（Tool）**。这个工具可以帮助提出正确的问题。这也简化了随后的搜索、过滤、分析过程。所以我们休息一下再看这个工具。好的，我们休息大概 10 分钟够了吗。最晚 40 分回来，但尽量在 35 分到这里。好的，那我们早点结束我们……

  * [19:39 - 19:56] **The Information Needs Template: Developing Intelligence Questions**
    And I'll do a simple exercise with you. Maybe I'll do it after I explain. Okay, can anyone tell what this tool is actually about? What this tool talks about? It's about coming up with a question. And you come up with a question collaboratively. That's why it is a tool. And in the process of coming up with that question that you're going to focus on for intelligence collaboratively, you also engage in the intelligence activity of gathering information. How do you go about doing it? Start from where?
    Let's assume that, or let's say that you're going to think of adopting a technology. One of you mentioned technology adoption, right? So here is the technology—that's the first step. You're going to come up with questions that would help you decide on whether you're going to adopt the technology in the organization or not, if that's the case. After the first step of identifying that technology, you're going to talk about **Application Areas**. What does that mean? What can the technology be used for? Where can the technology be used? And why would you do that?
    *Student:* Show market research. Where we can sell the technology.
    *Professor:* So this is more on the first case, right. If you're coming up with a new product, then what you're saying makes sense. If I'm coming up with the technology, if I were to invest in developing a technology, right, then you will talk about where the technology can be applied. Could it be applied in renewable energy sources? Could it be applied to autonomous vehicles? So you will start thinking like how **Dyson** thought: "The motor helps not just in a vacuum cleaner, it also helps in other products," etc. That's how you will think when you're coming up with a product, you know what I mean? But the context that we are talking about is adopting a technology *into* my organization. Then application areas would mean... the broader the application areas where the technology could be adopted and implemented, the more advantageous it is for me.
    Right? Because if there are two competing technologies: if one technology could be applied only in my marketing department and nowhere else, but the other technology could be applied for the marketing department, operational department, warehouse, logistics, whatnot—service sector, sales—wouldn't I bet on that technology better than the other technology? So when you are assessing such things itself, the decision maker would know: "Okay, this technology seems to be promising, more than the other one." Good idea. So intelligence automatically happens when there is a workshop happening with such tools.
    Narrowing down your search, and once the technology is picked and you start assessing where all it can be applied... Okay, if there are two technologies that a decision maker has in mind, the moment people say... that's why in **Kerr's** article, you have people from different departments. Why? Because it's a new technology. Someone from a different department will have a vision: "Oh, it could be applied in my department like this." They can voice it out, you see? So you have stakeholders from various groups brainstorming on where all the technology could be adopted. Or, "What all areas could a new technology which I am developing be utilized in?"—because they are my potential markets. You see, in the case of what Canton said, that is going to decide on the revenue that it will fetch once you do it.
    Then comes the part "above and below." You will start pondering about **Technological Aspects** on the lower bottom and **Market and Commercial Aspects** on the upper part. Let's discuss both contexts. If you're talking about adoption of a technology, what are technological or scientific questions that merit attention? Obvious, right? "How advanced is the technology?" "How revolutionary is the technology?" If it's too revolutionary, I have to revamp all my existing things to adopt a new technology that is destructive to my organization. What else?
    *Student:* What skills do I need to do?
    *Professor:* What skills do I need to [have]? It comes both here as well as there. If I'm a manager, if I were to adopt this, is my workforce skilled enough to adopt it or not? It's also a managerial question. What else?
    *Student:* The integration, the fit to the current company.
    *Professor:* That's what—how revolutionary it is. Would it fit my existing organizational setup and infrastructure or whatever?
    *Student:* You look at the cost to maintain the new product?
    *Professor:* Exactly. It comes under both technological and managerial. How expensive it is and can I afford it? Will I be able to see benefits of it as well, right? It comes under both blocks, but you need to separate it out. That is why you have people from different departments. Yes.
    *Student:* What is the readiness level of the technology?
    *Professor:* Exactly. Do I have the appetite? Remember the TRL (Technology Readiness Level) last week that we spoke about? Do I have the appetite or ability to adopt it? Let's give a chance to those who have never spoken in class. **Aishwarya** and **Amrita**, do you have anything to add?
    *Student:* If the customer will want it or not, any customer will need this technology.
    *Professor:* That will come for the second one which she mentioned. If I am developing the technology, I am assuming that all these are the application areas, but would my customers want it? Can they afford to buy it? That will be the other.
    *Student:* How much time it will take to...
    *Professor:* Very good. If it's a technology, it's going to take too long. Can I afford to wait that long? How long will it take to implement?
    *Student:* Does it have any ethical problems?
    *Professor:* Very nice. That's one of the problems which I had with the canvas and you rightly pointed out. While it talks about Technical and Management and Commercial, it does not stand up much for Ethical and Policy aspects as well. Very nice, thank you. Anything else? Anytime you talk about ethics, it will win my heart. I'm giving you the secret recipe for your logbook. But you need to use it wisely, okay? You cannot just go "blah blah blah" with ethics.
    So once you identify the context and identify the technology, you have a session of brainstorming to discuss the various technical, commercial, ethical, socio-political, policy-related questions. So once you have all these discussions happening, eventually they are narrowed down to a set of **Critical Questions** on which you're going to engage your analyst to work. From all these things, how would you arrive at this? Do you have to come to an agreement? These are very critical questions. If different stakeholders feel this is an important question, that automatically goes there. So it's not the boss—the boss is also there, but he collectively listens to people. Even in top-down, it could be consensual. You get input from various stakeholders to arrive at the questions which are critical for the organization. Now it becomes very focused. Now analysts know what they are going to work on.
    Right. Once this is done, it doesn't mean the workshop has ended and gone. They talk about *this* part. What is the second part? The second part is about: **"Identify local sources that should be watched. Identify distant sources that should be watched. Identify those sources that should be engaged."** This is very much similar to what we discussed. So when you have these decision makers from different departments together, you don't stop by just arriving at the right questions. Because these decision makers are senior officials who are well connected. Many times they can also act like scouts because of their networking. So when you arrive at those questions during the workshop, you also ask them: "Whom to watch and whom to talk to within and outside the industry?" And they will be giving bits and pieces of information which can be picked by the analysts for later on. So it kind of narrows down your search activities.
    I'll give you a very simple example of this—how critical this is. When NUS... let's take the example of **NUS** wanting to bet on either **Virtual Reality (VR)** technologies or **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. Let's take this context, okay? Immediately you can see: of the two technologies, which one will have broader application areas? Virtual Reality or Artificial Intelligence? Artificial Intelligence, right? That has broader scope. If you look at VR, it's more like simulated experiments, labs, etc., training purposes and everything. But AI could have wider applications from all departments as well.
    Right now, when that was narrowed down, they started looking—this was a few years ago—they started looking at the technical aspects and whether we can adopt it. "How competent are we?" That's when, if you remember, you have been around for long. About 5 or 6 years ago there was a massive e-learning course which was thrown out on **IVLE**. We had IVLE at that point, not Canvas. It was a predecessor of Canvas that we have got. Everyone, all walks of NUS, they were asked to do data analysis courses. Faculty members, everybody, IT department. Massive e-learning course on upgrading our data analysis skills. And then comes when the official—at that point it was **Tan Eng Chye**, right?—so when he used to talk highly of these companies in China from the insurance sector, not even in the education sector, which was big time using AI to be a strategic advantage. So he used to call officials from there and give public lectures. Why? Because the other sources to watch were coming from "Big Shots." Because he travels extensively, he knows whom to watch or whom to talk to. And then the job of the analyst becomes a little easier because it is streamlined.
    So this is one way, if you were to conduct TI foresighting activities in your organization, how can you come up [with the questions]? Because if the question is wrong, everything goes wrong. Right. Whatever the right question... and not just talk, they also go one step further in terms of identifying sources, which makes your job easy.
    So going back to the first day activity: if you were engaged as an analyst, what would you do? What is the first step that you would do? Remember Week 1? Call him. Come here and invite me also. And you also. With your friends and everybody, right? And neighbors and everyone. So that's what you do—infrastructure folks—and then start doing this exercise. Come up with the question that you're going to get data on. Very simple tool, right?
    I used to hate my boss then who asked me, "Hey come on, do this module," you know? I said, "Oh, this is... this has no head, no tail, this course. How do I teach this?" And then it took years to go... they talk to people. And that's why I have so many guest lectures because each one of them is expert in their individual areas, gather bits and pieces and put them into a coherent framework. It wasn't a joke, but I love him for making me do that now. Because this course is not offered by many schools. **Cambridge** is the place for this. And they, you know, this tool also came from Cambridge. Yeah, yeah. And by the way, if you want to use any of these tools, I can talk to those folks because... additionally they have done this during COVID time. Everything used to be in the form of... you know when **Rob Phaal** conducts R&D mapping, his sheet will be this one big paper there with officials sticking post-it notes. That's how he conducts R&D mapping in Singapore. I've seen him do that and all these tools are that big. But when COVID kicked in, everything swiftly digitized. Everything happened in digital form. Yeah, so some of the tools represent... ready use. He gives access to me and students in this class. And he gives a guest lecture if you want to use it for your own organization.
    我来和你们做一个简单的练习。也许我解释完之后再做。好的，谁能告诉我这个工具到底是关于什么的？这个工具讲的是什么？它是关于提出一个问题的。而且是协作提出问题。这就是为什么它是一个工具。在这个协作提出你要专注于情报的那个问题的过程中，你也参与了收集信息的情报活动。你如何着手做这件事？从哪里开始？
    假设，或者说你要考虑采用一项技术。你们中有人提到了技术采用，对吧？所以这里有一项技术——这是第一步。你要提出有助于你决定是否在组织中采用该技术的问题（如果是这种情况的话）。在第一步确定了那项技术之后，你要讨论 **应用领域（Application Areas）**。那意味着什么？这项技术可以用来做什么？这项技术可以用在哪里？你为什么要那样做？
    *学生：* 展示市场研究。我们可以在哪里销售这项技术。
    *教授：* 这更多是针对第一种情况，对。如果你是在推出一个新产品，那你说的有道理。如果我是提出一项技术，如果我要投资开发一项技术，对，那么你会谈论这项技术可以应用在哪里。它能应用在可再生能源领域吗？能应用在自动驾驶汽车上吗？所以你会开始像 **Dyson（戴森）** 那样思考：“电机不仅有助于吸尘器，还有助于其他产品，”等等。当你推出一个产品时，你会那样思考，你懂我的意思吗？但我们正在谈论的背景是将一项技术 *采用* 到我的组织中。那么应用领域就意味着……这项技术可以被采用和实施的应用领域越广，对我来说就越有利。
    对吗？因为如果有两项竞争技术：如果一项技术只能应用在我的营销部门，其他任何地方都不行；但另一项技术可以应用在营销部门、运营部门、仓库、物流、不管什么——服务部门、销售——我难道不会押注在那项技术上，而不是另一项吗？所以当你评估这些事情本身时，决策者就会知道：“好的，这项技术似乎比另一项更有前途。”好主意。所以当使用这样的工具进行研讨会时，情报活动会自动发生。
    缩小你的搜索范围，一旦选中了技术，你就开始评估它可以应用的所有地方……好的，如果决策者心中有两项技术，当人们说……这就是为什么在 **Kerr** 的文章中，你会让来自不同部门的人参与。为什么？因为这是一项新技术。来自不同部门的人会有愿景：“噢，它可以像这样应用在我的部门。”他们可以说出来，你看？所以你有来自不同群体的利益相关者进行头脑风暴，讨论这项技术可以被采用的所有地方。或者，“我正在开发的这项新技术可以在哪些领域被利用？”——因为它们是我的潜在市场。你看，就 Canton 所说的而言，一旦你做了，这将决定它将带来的收入。
    然后是“上面和下面”的部分。你会开始思考底部的 **技术方面** 和上部的 **市场与商业方面**。让我们讨论这两种背景。如果你在谈论采用一项技术，哪些技术或科学问题值得关注？很明显，对吧？“这项技术有多先进？”“这项技术有多具革命性？”如果它太具革命性，我必须彻底改造我现有的所有东西来采用一项对我组织具有破坏性的新技术。还有什么？
    *学生：* 我需要做什么技能？
    *教授：* 我需要[拥有]什么技能？这既涉及到这里也涉及到那里。如果我是经理，如果我要采用这个，我的员工是否有足够的技能来采用它？这也是一个管理问题。还有什么？
    *学生：* 整合，与当前公司的契合度。
    *教授：* 就是那个——它有多具革命性。它是否适合我现有的组织设置和基础设施或者其他什么？
    *学生：* 你看维护新产品的成本？
    *教授：* 没错。它既属于技术也属于管理。它有多贵，我能负担得起吗？我也能看到它的好处吗，对吧？它属于两个模块，但你需要把它分开。这就是为什么你有来自不同部门的人。是的。
    *学生：* 技术的就绪水平是什么？
    *教授：* 没错。我有胃口吗？还记得我们上周讲的 TRL（技术就绪指数）吗？我有胃口或能力采用它吗？让我们给那些从未在课堂上发过言的人一个机会。**Aishwarya** 和 **Amrita**，你们有什么要补充的吗？
    *学生：* 客户是否想要它，是否有客户需要这项技术。
    *教授：* 那会属于她提到的第二个问题。如果我在开发技术，我假设所有这些都是应用领域，但我的客户会想要它吗？他们买得起吗？那将是另一个问题。
    *学生：* 需要多长时间才能……
    *教授：* 很好。如果是技术，它需要太长时间。我能等那么久吗？实施需要多长时间？
    *学生：* 它有任何伦理问题吗？
    *教授：* 非常好。那是我对这个画布（Canvas）有的问题之一，你正确地指出了。虽然它谈论了技术、管理和商业，但它在伦理和政策方面并没有体现太多。非常好，谢谢你。还有别的吗？任何时候你谈论伦理，都会赢得我的心。我在给你们 Logbook 的秘方。但你需要明智地使用它，好吗？你不能只是关于伦理“巴拉巴拉”一通。
    所以一旦你确定了背景并确定了技术，你就要进行头脑风暴会议，讨论各种技术、商业、伦理、社会政治、政策相关的问题。所以一旦你有所有这些讨论发生，最终它们会被缩小到一组 **关键问题（Critical Questions）**，你将让你的分析师针对这些问题工作。从所有这些事情中，你如何得出这个？你必须达成一致吗？这些是非常关键的问题。如果不同的利益相关者觉得这是一个重要问题，那它会自动进入那里。所以不是老板——老板也在那里，但他集体听取人们的意见。即使在自上而下的模式中，它也可以是共识性的。你从各种利益相关者那里获得输入，以得出对组织至关重要的问题。现在它变得非常聚焦。现在分析师知道他们要研究什么了。
    对。一旦这完成了，并不意味着研讨会就结束了。他们会谈论 *这* 部分。第二部分是关于：**“确定应该关注的本地来源。确定应该关注的远程来源。确定应该接触的来源。”** 这与我们讨论的非常相似。所以当你有这些来自不同部门的决策者在一起时，你不会止步于仅仅得出正确的问题。因为这些决策者是人脉广泛的高级官员。很多时候，由于他们的人脉网络，他们也可以充当侦察员。所以当你在研讨会上得出这些问题时，你也问他们：“在行业内外应该关注谁，应该和谁交谈？”他们会给出零碎的信息，分析师可以在以后通过评论拾取这些信息。所以这在某种程度上缩小了你的搜索活动。
    我给你们一个非常简单的例子——这有多关键。当 **NUS**……让我们以 NUS 想要押注 **虚拟现实（VR）** 技术还是 **人工智能（AI）** 为例。让我们以此为背景，好吗？立刻你可以看到：在这两项技术中，哪一项会有更广泛的应用领域？虚拟现实还是人工智能？人工智能，对吧？那个有更广泛的范围。如果你看 VR，它更像是模拟实验、实验室等，培训目的和一切。但 AI 可以有更广泛的应用，来自所有部门。
    现在，当那个被缩小范围后，他们开始看——这是几年前的事了——他们开始看技术方面以及我们是否能采用它。“我们有多大能力？”就在那时，如果你还记得，如果你在这里待得够久。大约 5 或 6 年前，有一个大规模的电子学习课程在 **IVLE** 上推出。那时我们用的是 IVLE，不是 Canvas。它是我们现在拥有的 Canvas 的前身。每个人，NUS 的各行各业，都被要求做数据分析课程。教职员工，每个人，IT 部门。大规模的电子学习课程，提升我们的数据分析技能。然后当官员——在那时是 **Tan Eng Chye（陈永财）**，对吧？——所以当他过去高度评价中国保险行业的这些公司时，甚至不是教育行业的，它们大量使用 AI 作为战略优势。所以他过去常给那里的官员打电话，并做公开讲座。为什么？因为其他要关注的来源来自“大人物”。因为他经常出差，他知道该关注谁或该和谁交谈。然后分析师的工作变得稍微容易一些，因为它是流水线化的。
    所以这是一种方法，如果你要在你的组织中进行 TI 预见活动，你如何提出[问题]？因为如果问题错了，一切都错了。对。无论什么是正确的问题……不仅是谈论，他们还在确定来源方面更进一步，这让你的工作变得容易。
    所以回到第一天的活动：如果你被聘为分析师，你会做什么？你会做的第一步是什么？还记得第一周吗？给他打电话。来这里，也邀请我。还有你。和你的朋友们，每个人，对吧？还有邻居和每个人。所以那就是你要做的——基础设施人员——然后开始做这个练习。提出你要获取数据的问题。非常简单的工具，对吧？
    我曾经讨厌我的老板，当时他问我，“嘿，来吧，做这个模块，”你知道吗？我说，“噢，这是……这门课没头没尾的。我怎么教这个？”然后花了好几年去……他们和人交谈。这就是为什么我有这么多客座讲座，因为他们每个人都是各自领域的专家，收集零碎信息并将它们放入一个连贯的框架中。这不是开玩笑，但我现在爱死他让我做这个了。因为这门课很多学校都没有开设。**剑桥（Cambridge）** 是这方面的地方。而且他们，你知道，这个工具也是来自剑桥。是的，是的。顺便说一句，如果你想使用这些工具中的任何一个，我可以和那些人谈谈，因为……另外他们在 COVID 期间做了这个。以前一切都是以……的形式，你知道当 **Rob Phaal** 进行研发路线图绘制（R&D mapping）时，他的纸会是那张大纸，官员们在上面贴便利贴。这就是他在新加坡进行研发路线图绘制的方式。我见过他那样做，所有这些工具都那么大。但当 COVID 爆发时，一切都迅速数字化了。一切都以数字形式发生。是的，所以有些工具代表……现成可用的。他给我和这门课的学生提供了访问权限。如果你想为你自己的组织使用它，他会做一个客座讲座。
  * [19:56 - 20:16] **Organizational Structures for Intelligence: Structured, Informal, Hybrid**
    Okay, now coming back to the framework. Next important topic is **Structure**. What structure? This comes from various articles which are in the reading list. I said don't have to read it because they're not easy to read. That is why I said don't shield it. What is structure? Structure is: how are you going to plan, structure the intelligence activities? How the various people are going to be disposed in an organization? What kind of mode do you need to adopt? And typically there are three structures floating around. One is **Structured Approach** (Centralized). The other one is the **Informal Approach** (Decentralized). Third one is the **Hybrid Approach**. Nothing rocket science. It's something we discussed. It's very similar to the top-down, bottom-up approach.
    **Structured Approach** is where there is a **Central TI Unit** (Intelligence Unit), which is typically located at the headquarters. And they will have analysts, they will have key people there. And to help them, there will be **Decentralized TI Units**. There are quite a few in Singapore as decentralized units because [they want] to tap into the Asian region intelligence. And apart from that, they also have all these people to help them. What are these people? It could be VC funding. Since you spoke about VC, it could be that there is a Venture Capital fund department in the company which is given some resource. What is the use of that unit for Intelligence? They will go and look for what is the latest... see from those, and if it becomes promising, bring in-house. They are also part of the intelligence unit.
    And **Post-docs and Sabbaticals**. There is one article which I have given on **Kodak**. This company doesn't exist now [in the same form]. At that point they were very smart in intelligence but they got disrupted because of technological [change]. And one of the ways when they were expanding to different regions was to have interns/post-docs. They used to ask them: if they're expanding into a region, they would have post-docs from that region to go and ask, "Who is the top-notch researcher in that place whom I can collaborate with? Which funding agency is good?" So they also become part of your intelligence, just that they're all outsiders. Most of these people are insiders.
    They have **Technology Envoys** or typical **Listening Posts**. These are people who are parked in different locations for the company not to do much of a job other than listening and gathering information and passing it on. Also have **Expert Collectors**, that's what I told about the pharmaceutical industry. No company is hiring one consultant meeting in the airport; they're all part of the expert networks. And then lead suppliers, sometimes customers, they are also your intelligence agents; they give information as well. So what they do is, while all the decision making is done at headquarters—it's very top-down—if some intelligence needs to be sought from Asia, they would pass the question to these units or they try to mobilize anyone of those to get the information. And then they collect the information from these decentralized stores and they give it to the decision maker. They take the decision and it's passed off to various entities. It's very structured. Very hierarchical.
    Now, what is **Informal Structure**? Informal structure is what you all talked about wherein everyone becomes an intelligence agent, right? Everyone does the job. And there might be a central intelligence unit, but their job is more like **establishing communication routines and reward mechanisms**. Ensure that you have proper incentives. For example, there is **Slack Resources** in place which I mentioned—giving employees freedom, slack time for them to work on intelligence sources. Have communication strategies, knowledge management structures, infrastructure for **Communities of Practice**. This is knowledge management: people get together and talk about ideas. Incentives. Reward mechanisms. **Job Rotation**. Why do you have job rotation? You enable these things. Your job is to enable all these things happening so that someone said, right, "We all become knowledge workers, we gather information and then we pass it on." For that to happen, you have all these mechanisms. What is the purpose of job rotation?
    *Student:* First, transfer the knowledge. Secondly, you can improve the process by addressing the gap.
    *Professor:* Address cross-pollination of ideas. Understand... you know one of you mentioned about "this person did not understand, couldn't be integrated." And in fact in many good organizations that I know of, you will not be able to climb up the ladder unless you have been exposed to different functional areas in the company and also different regions as well. Okay, there are companies that anyone undergoing that... you will be put into different functional areas.
    One of my... I had a master student, she was a very smart student from the **Philippines**. She was an ASEAN scholar who came to do a master's program and she was hired by one of the companies—a good company, a consulting company—and she was put into different, you know, job roles: operational, sometimes in the warehouse, sometimes the marketing department, and she was made to travel around the world. And it's only after that you will be able to climb up the ladder. Otherwise you're done. If you leave the organization, you cannot reach the benefits out of it. That is when you know you become a better knowledge worker to add to the organization. That's what they do. This is Informal. So the job of central unit is to ensure that every mechanism is put in place for it to function smoothly, enable that the information flows up. Enable that employees are pumped up to work on [it]. Enable that latest cross-pollination of ideas.
    Now what is **Hybrid**? It can happen this way as well with central unit delegating the job. But in some situations, let's say you know what happened in a pharmaceutical company again, is that when this **Combinatorial Chemistry** came about? They thought, "Okay, this is going to be disruptive," so they formed a group of people. They started forming a **Community of Practice** on this topic, combinatorial chemistry, to understand more about it. And then when enough interest and momentum gathered, it became a separate intelligence unit on its own. Okay. And once it matured, it was integrated back to the central unit. So it's like informal groups created, but once it became matured and became important, sometimes the informal group will decide that "Okay, this is not going to help," so let's ditch it. That also happens. But if it becomes something solid and important, it gets integrated into the Central Intelligence Unit.
    So now the question is: **Which structure to adopt?** Goes back to the same thing in reality. There are organizations which adopt only a single mode approach wherein we take either structured approach or informal approach. But there are organizations which adopt multi-role approaches. Okay, which means all three approaches together. They might be central structure, but it's more like they have informal as well. Both work together and it all depends on the company culture and decision making style—whether it's centralized, decentralized or how entrepreneurial is the company culture. And what this chart says is how different industries either go with one mode or multi-mode. The latest industries are all in here. They will go with multi-modes having a more entrepreneurial culture.
    Okay. So what structure is there in your company? You don't have one? Are you doing this more informal? Meredith, so what is your thing?
    *Student (Meredith):* Structured.
    *Professor:* Structured. Coming from Singapore government agency, right? It's very, very structured. Or was it formed ad hoc? That's why the structured approach will go. In see people, this has happened in Singapore wherein when R&D planning happens... before that they usually... you know **Yeoh Keat Chuan** (Managing Director of EDB)? He was a creator. Before deciding on the pillars, Singapore invited top-notch researchers from all parts of the world to assemble there and decide on the pillars to focus on everything. Research grants to apply on. So it was a very interesting process. I happened to witness one such. That's when I called another fund as well. I was presenting to them and I got the funding for the **Gas Hydrates** study at that point. Yeah, security. Which structure? I will call you "security of the class."
    *Student:* Structured. So at HQ there is...
    *Professor:* Very much structured like this. Intelligence of the unit, right? They are the real intelligence of the unit. It happens even in, you know, when we cover knowledge management. I'll talk about one of the things which you all might know, many of you might have done in NS (National Service) as well: **After Action Review**. It's a structured intelligence group, actually very much right. It all comes from military, yes.
    *Student:* I have a question regarding this. You also mentioned like as an SME (Small and Medium Enterprise). I think it is very informal type of thing but I have a question because the way I see it: once you go higher up the ladder from a small and medium enterprise and scale up and become a large, large enterprise—like how you talk about government companies being large enterprises—is it better for an SME to be in an informal [structure]? Or can an SME be in a structural? Or is it hierarchical in a way which... this is what works best? And large companies, it works best with being a structural or can large companies also be informal?
    *Professor:* And yeah, the large companies that I showed you, many of them are informal. So it's not necessarily the case. It's not over the size alone. It's also the culture. You know **Google**, right? So it's not [just size]. But having said that, what small and medium enterprises can afford is only informal. They can't afford to have a bunch of... they can't even afford to have R&D folks in Singapore. That's what they saw. Then come intelligence folks alone, right. So having said that, that's why they want to move from a very non-foresight anything. The foresight when they try to adapt that structured approach benefits by licensing **A*STAR**. And these programs and all having technical advisors going through mapping activities with A*STAR. So they try to reap the benefits of structured approach by falling back on "Big Brothers." But otherwise, informal is what they can afford. But it becomes easier for small and medium enterprise. Why? Because the communication flows easily. Good. Anything else you can ask this question to **Vinod** when he comes? He worked for a large company and then he has his own startup. We will talk about R&D mapping and...
    *Student:* I can't believe that you don't do informal intelligence... it will happen in every organization but the question is whether you're being...
    *Professor:* You know, like group discussion or focus group discussion and all this is so informal, right? You can gather information on the ground, exactly. But what do they do? Many times the focus group remains discussion. It stops there. But does it go up? That defines whether it is working or not. Don't tell me... even if they seek ideas from you, that is one element of intelligence happening. But how they act on it? Even feedback box. As simple as that. It is intelligence gathering but how they act on it?
    I don't know if I mentioned this to my other class last semester. You know the **Colgate** company, right? That makes toothpaste. Let me try to remember this example. Okay. Colgate, at some point, they were not seeing any increase in sales. They were kind of stagnating. Okay, they were getting, of course, whoever bought this, they got the money first from the toothpaste. And then the boss of the company, he let out an open question saying that: "Anyone with bright ideas in increasing our sales revenue, come up with me. It will be rewarded." This was a question. The question is to increase the sales revenue. And of course, there were many ideas that came in.
    But the idea which was implemented was from a security [guard]... he was at the gate, you know, a security of the organization. He gave the idea that: **"Just increase the mouth of your toothpaste by a slight margin."** So if the hole becomes slightly larger, what happens? More paste dispenses. The idea was so damn simple coming from a security guard which was implemented. That is the biggest part, right? It was implemented to increase the sale and it helped. No wonder now we have different sizes, right? Small, large and you know, but sometimes the hole is larger for even for a small tube. So but that came from intelligence from someone which you might not have easily thought. That is an organizational culture—being heard from anybody and implementing.
    Now. So what do the cases talk about? Firms can have multiple structures at the same time. The kind of structure they adopt and how effective it is will depend on a lot of contextual factors. Depends on culture. How centralized or decentralized? One of the reward mechanisms are these **Slack Resources**. Slack resource is a big research topic. If an organization is not giving slack resources, you can't do informal intelligence, right? What are slack resources? Apart from your day-to-day job, you have some pocket of money for doing these exploratory activities. We do have what is called **STAR Grant**, which our department gives every now and then that we can use it to pay for research assistants, exploratory projects and everything. They don't constrain you on how you have to use it. There are of course constraints because we're in NUS in Singapore. But it's still opening, not like the strict class. Then how geographically disposed the company is—that also determines how effective the different structures can be, effective communications. And industry specific. Earlier we saw in the previous graph that machinery kind of very traditional ones are more towards this side—structured approach. Whereas new upcoming industries are more here on the right hand side. Nothing more. Okay.
    好的，现在回到框架。下一个重要的话题是 **结构（Structure）**。什么结构？这来自阅读清单中的各种文章。我说过不必读，因为它们不容易读。这就是为什么我说不要回避它。什么是结构？结构是：你打算如何规划、构建情报活动？各种人员在组织中如何配置？你需要采用什么样的模式？通常有三种结构在流传。一种是 **结构化方法（Structured Approach，集中式）**。另一种是 **非正式方法（Informal Approach，分散式）**。第三种是 **混合方法（Hybrid Approach）**。没什么深奥的。这是我们讨论过的东西。这与自上而下、自下而上的方法非常相似。
    **结构化方法** 是指有一个 **中央 TI 单元（Central TI Unit）**（情报单元），通常位于总部。他们会有分析师，那里会有关键人员。为了帮助他们，会有 **分散的 TI 单元**。在新加坡有不少分散的单元，因为[他们想]利用亚洲地区的情报。除此之外，他们还有所有这些人来帮助他们。这些人是什么？可能是风投（VC）资金。既然你提到了风投，可能是公司里有一个风险投资基金部门，被给予了一些资源。那个单元对情报有什么用？他们会去寻找最新的……从那些里面看，如果变得有前途，就引入内部。他们也是情报单元的一部分。
    还有 **博士后和休假人员**。我给过一篇关于 **Kodak（柯达）** 的文章。这家公司现在不存在了[以同样的形式]。在那时他们在情报方面非常聪明，但因为技术[变革]而被颠覆了。当他们向不同地区扩张时，方法之一就是拥有实习生/博士后。他们过去常问他们：如果他们要扩张到一个地区，他们会让那个地区的博士后去问，“那个地方谁是顶尖的研究人员，我可以和谁合作？哪个资助机构好？”所以他们也成了你情报的一部分，只是他们都是外人。这些大多数人是内部人员。
    他们有 **技术特使（Technology Envoys）** 或典型的 **监听站（Listening Posts）**。这些人被安置在公司的不同地点，除了倾听和收集信息并传递之外，不做太多工作。还有 **专家收集者（Expert Collectors）**，那就是我讲过的制药行业。没有公司是雇佣一个顾问在机场开会的；他们都是专家网络的一部分。然后主要供应商，有时是客户，他们也是你的情报代理人；他们也提供信息。所以他们做的是，虽然所有的决策都在总部完成——这是非常自上而下的——如果需要从亚洲寻求一些情报，他们会把问题传递给这些单元，或者试图动员其中任何一个来获取信息。然后他们从这些分散的存储中收集信息，交给决策者。他们做决定，然后传递给各个实体。这是非常结构化的。非常等级森严。
    现在，什么是 **非正式结构**？非正式结构就是你们都谈到的，每个人都成为情报代理人，对吧？每个人都做这份工作。可能会有一个中央情报单元，但他们的工作更像是 **建立沟通程序和奖励机制**。确保你有适当的激励措施。例如，有适当的 **松弛资源（Slack Resources）**，这是我提到的——给员工自由，给他们松弛时间去研究情报来源。有沟通策略，知识管理结构，**实践社区（Communities of Practice）** 的基础设施。这就是知识管理：人们聚在一起谈论想法。激励措施。奖励机制。**工作轮换（Job Rotation）**。为什么要有工作轮换？你启用这些事情。你的工作是促成所有这些事情发生，以便有人说的，对，“我们都成为知识工作者，我们收集信息然后传递它。”为了发生这种情况，你有所有这些机制。工作轮换的目的是什么？
    *学生：* 首先，转移知识。其次，你可以通过解决差距来改进流程。
    *教授：* 解决思想的交叉授粉。理解……你们中有人提到“这个人不理解，无法整合。”事实上，在我知道的许多好公司里，除非你接触过公司里的不同职能领域以及不同地区，否则你无法晋升。好的，有些公司，任何经历过那个的人……你会被放到不同的职能领域。
    我的一个……我有一个硕士生，她是来自 **菲律宾** 的非常聪明的学生。她是一名来读硕士项目的东盟学者，她被其中一家公司雇佣了——一家好公司，一家咨询公司——她被放到不同的，你知道，工作角色中：运营，有时在仓库，有时在营销部门，她被安排在世界各地旅行。只有在那之后你才能晋升。否则你就完了。如果你离开组织，你就无法从中获得好处。那就是你知道你成为一个更好的知识工作者来为组织增值的时候。那就是他们做的。这是非正式的。所以中央单元的工作是确保每一个机制都到位以使其平稳运行，促使信息向上流动。促使员工有动力去工作。促使最新的思想交叉授粉。
    现在什么是 **混合结构**？也可以这样发生，中央单元委派工作。但在某些情况下，比方说你知道在一家制药公司又发生了什么，就是当 **组合化学（Combinatorial Chemistry）** 出现时？他们想，“好的，这将是颠覆性的，”所以他们组成了一群人。他们开始就这个话题，组合化学，形成一个 **实践社区**，以了解更多。然后当聚集了足够的兴趣和势头时，它变成了一个独立的、自成一体的情报单元。好的。一旦它成熟了，它就被重新整合回中央单元。所以这就像创建了非正式小组，但一旦它成熟并变得重要，有时非正式小组会决定“好的，这没有帮助，”所以让我们放弃它。那也会发生。但如果它变成了某种坚实而重要的东西，它就会被整合进中央情报单元。
    所以现在的问题是：**采用哪种结构？** 在现实中回到同样的事情。有些组织只采用单一模式方法，即我们要么采取结构化方法，要么采取非正式方法。但也有组织采用多角色方法。好的，这意味着所有三种方法一起。他们可能有中央结构，但更像是他们也有非正式的。两者一起工作，这完全取决于公司文化和决策风格——是集中的、分散的，还是公司文化有多具创业精神。这张图表说的是不同的行业如何要么采用单一模式，要么采用多模式。最新的行业都在这里。他们会采用多模式，拥有更具创业精神的文化。
    好的。那么你们公司是什么结构？你们没有？你们做得更非正式吗？Meredith，你的情况呢？
    *学生（Meredith）：* 结构化的。
    *教授：* 结构化的。来自新加坡政府机构，对吧？非常非常结构化。或者是临时组建的？这就是为什么结构化方法会行得通。你看，这在新加坡发生过，当研发规划发生时……在此之前他们通常……你知道 **Yeoh Keat Chuan（杨吉全）**（EDB 董事总经理）吗？他是一个创造者。在决定支柱产业之前，新加坡邀请来自世界各地的顶尖研究人员聚集在那里，决定专注于什么支柱产业。申请研究拨款。所以那是一个非常有趣的过程。我碰巧见证了一次。那就是我给另一个基金打电话的时候。我在向他们做演示，那时我拿到了 **天然气水合物（Gas Hydrates）** 研究的资金。是的，安全部门。哪种结构？我会叫你“班级安全员”。
    *学生：* 结构化的。所以在总部有……
    *教授：* 非常像这样结构化的。单元的智能，对吧？他们是单元真正的智能。这甚至发生在，你知道，当我们讲知识管理时。我会谈论一件你们可能都知道的事，很多人在国民服役（NS）时可能也做过：**行动后回顾（After Action Review）**。这是一个结构化的情报小组，实际上非常对。它全都来自军队，是的。
    *学生：* 我对此有一个问题。你也提到了像中小企业（SME）。我认为这是非常非正式的事情，但我有一个问题，因为在我看来：一旦你从中小企业往上爬，扩大规模成为大型、巨型企业——像你说政府公司是大型企业——中小企业处于非正式[结构]更好吗？还是中小企业可以是结构化的？或者是等级制的……这是效果最好的？大公司是结构化的效果最好，还是大公司也可以是非正式的？
    *教授：* 是的，我给你们看的大公司，很多都是非正式的。所以情况不一定如此。不仅仅是规模的问题。也是文化的问题。你知道 **Google**，对吧？所以不[仅仅是规模]。但话虽如此，中小企业能负担得起的只有非正式的。他们养不起一群……他们在新加坡甚至养不起研发人员。那就是他们看到的。然后只有情报人员，对。所以话虽如此，这就是为什么他们想从一个非常没有预见的状态转变。当他们试图适应那种结构化方法带来的预见好处时，通过获得 **A*STAR（新科研）** 的许可。以及这些项目，所有这些有技术顾问与 A*STAR 一起进行绘图活动的。所以他们试图通过依靠“老大哥”来获得结构化方法的好处。但除此之外，非正式是他们能负担得起的。但这对于中小企业来说变得更容易。为什么？因为沟通流动很容易。很好。还有什么你可以问 **Vinod**，当他来的时候？他在大公司工作过，然后他有自己的初创公司。我们会谈论研发绘图和……
    *学生：* 我不敢相信你们不做非正式情报……这在每个组织都会发生，但问题是你们是否正在……
    *教授：* 你知道，像小组讨论或焦点小组讨论，所有这些都是如此非正式，对吧？你可以收集地面上的信息，没错。但他们做什么？很多时候焦点小组仍然是讨论。它停在那里。但它有向上传递吗？那定义了它是否在起作用。别告诉我……即使他们向你寻求想法，那也是情报发生的一个要素。但他们如何根据它行动？甚至意见箱。就这么简单。它是情报收集，但他们如何根据它行动？
    我不知道我是否在上学期给我的另一个班提到过这个。你们知道 **Colgate（高露洁）** 公司，对吧？做牙膏的。让我试着回忆这个例子。好的。高露洁，在某个时刻，他们的销售额没有看到任何增长。他们有点停滞不前。好的，他们当然在赚钱，不管谁买了牙膏。然后公司的老板，他放出了一个开放性问题，说：“任何有增加我们销售收入的好主意的人，来找我。会有奖励。”这是一个问题。问题是增加销售收入。当然，有很多想法进来了。
    但被实施的想法来自一个保安……他在大门口，你知道，组织的一个保安。他给出了这个主意：**“只要把牙膏口稍微增大一点。”** 所以如果孔稍微变大，会发生什么？更多的牙膏被挤出来。这个来自保安的主意是如此该死的简单，它被实施了。那是最大的部分，对吧？它被实施以增加销售，而且它奏效了。难怪现在我们有不同尺寸的，对吧？小的，大的，你知道，但有时即使对于小管，孔也是大的。所以那来自某人的情报，你可能不会轻易想到。那就是一种组织文化——听取任何人的意见并实施。
    现在。所以案例说明了什么？公司可以同时拥有多种结构。他们采用什么样的结构以及它有多有效将取决于许多背景因素。取决于文化。是集中式还是分散式？奖励机制之一是这些 **松弛资源（Slack Resources）**。松弛资源是一个很大的研究课题。如果一个组织不给松弛资源，你就不能做非正式情报，对吧？什么是松弛资源？除了你的日常工作，你有一些钱袋子用于做这些探索性活动。我们确实有所谓的 **STAR Grant**，我们系时不时会给，我们可以用它来支付研究助理、探索性项目等等。他们不限制你必须如何使用它。当然有因为我们在新加坡 NUS 的限制。但它仍然是开放的，不像严格的课程。然后公司在地理上如何分布——这也决定了不同结构的有效性，有效的沟通。以及行业特定的。早些时候我们在之前的图表中看到，机械类那种非常传统的行业更多偏向这一边——结构化方法。而新兴行业更多在右边。仅此而已。好的。
  * [20:16 - 20:24] **Next Week's Plan & The "Boring Paper" Assignment**
    Then once you have all this in place, the actual job is done right? But when you do the actual job, there are many things there. But we'll talk about this maybe next week, okay. Because it will lead to Knowledge Management and I can start knowledge management next week itself and then take it up to the week after as well. But next week **Renee** will be giving a guest lecture. Keep that in mind, okay. Now the question is next week: he's in France, so he has to talk via Zoom. Do you want to do a Zoom session here or you want it to be from there? I can connect my lecture from home as well after the Zoom lecture.
    I love you. Had it been my other semester, I was saying... "Zoom." They wouldn't even ask "What do you prefer?" They'll say "Zoom" automatic. How many of you prefer Zoom for the whole of next week? How many of you want to see me here? I won't believe you, but this guy was very nice. He came and checked with me before break: "Are you doing fine?" Because I had given my husband's phone number [saying] "If anything happens to me, call my husband." So very few are opting for in-class, so we'll go to Zoom lecture, okay? We'll have Renee's first and then I'll have my lecture on Zoom. We'll cover the rest of this.
    But now going back to where we started off. At least now can you answer this question? So if you were to initiate [TI], what would you do first? Go look for information. Have an idea of what is your company? How do I go about doing it? First is that. Then comes "What structure will work right? What structure will not work?" How do I go looking for a source for that and then bringing everybody, arriving at that question? What is the question that you're going to work on? Then comes looking for information and whether you're integrated etc., etc., etc. All you had mentioned was [part of it], but there is something higher level that has to happen before any of the things... except for Domain [expert], she wins in the first. She's always looking from above, right? And when she was able to picture that, is that clear? So this is how you start TI activities in your company, understanding the organization.
    I'll be here if there are any questions. It was one during the break. Okay, start working on your logbooks and keep sending me if you have any questions that you want to see feedback on. That's how it works because the deadline is towards the end and please submit **one file** which has all the weeks. Don't submit 5 different files. Name your file with your metric. The way I work, those who did class with me last semester, they know: if you work on your logbook, send it to me. I'll give you feedback to improve on. You can start building on it, don't send me all your logical [drafts]... it's like giving away your mark, right? Don't do that. Give feedback, work on it and then it goes. That's how it goes. And if you finish your logbook and you participate in class, 60% of the grading is done. And that's the final project, right? So try to finish everything.
    And I will give next week, I will give one boring paper for you to read. I told you, right? I won't forget that. You read the boring paper. This is going to be one. Okay, I'll mention this for those who did **MT5007**. Remember I mentioned standard work was one of the compulsory logbook essays? Can you believe still I had at least 5 submissions without the standard work in spite of telling a million times in class? Okay, don't repeat this. I don't think all students are in here, but if you're listening to me, I hope so. So that particular boring paper I want you all to read and you have two weeks of time to read, but three weeks right after next week, I won't see you in the following weeks. So read it and I'm pretty sure you won't be able to read in one go. The paper... you will see browser go to sleep. So read again.
    What I want out of the paper is: **try to synthesize the key message from the paper in the form of a Mind Map or Block Diagram or Picture.** So that is what analysts do. Read the boring of boring things, extract valuable information out of it and present it in a pictorial form. That's what is going to be one compulsory logbook [entry] which everyone will [do]. For those who are not here, there is one... for those who are sleeping, wake up at the back bench and who are not listening to me: there is one compulsory logbook that everyone should have in your logbook submissions, which is to read that boring paper that I give. I won't call it boring paper. It's a very valuable one. That's the author's name... **Lichtenthaler**. Paper and synthesize valuable... No, you need to know what is valuable and what is not valuable. There also must matter, okay. What is most valuable information? Pull it out and present it in a very concise, structured mind map or pictorial form. Any doubts on this? Because I can't tell this in person next week. I'm telling you, giving all the... Is there any doubts? Ask now.
    *Student:* What is the paper?
    *Professor:* If you want to... if you think you have given enough... I know the paper so I know she has covered enough information, but if you think certain sections you feel as important, or if you left out certain things because you didn't find it to be important, you can write. But shouldn't... there's no need. There is no fixed format for your logbook. I don't constrain you on you know by saying only this many pages. Feel free because that is to test how innovative you are. And innovation shouldn't be constrained beyond the point. That's why I'm not constrained. Yes, trying to shop technology.
    *Student:* Yes I think so but I need to go and because he has written 2 papers which I use. The one which is on passive learning and then that's his gaming. I will let you...
    *Professor:* We just did just that. I need to pull out because there are a few European authors. It's written by **Lichtenthaler**, that much I know. I will let you know because I don't... So that is the only one that is compulsory. That is the only one that is compulsory, okay. It's right there on the thing, just that there are two papers. I don't want to mix up doing it. After going to my next class I'll let you know. Anything else, say it out.
    然后一旦你有所有这些到位，实际的工作就完成了，对吧？但是当你做实际工作时，那里有很多事情。但我们也许下周再谈这个，好的。因为它将引出知识管理，我可以下周就开始讲知识管理，然后再延续到下下周。但下周 **Renee** 会做一个客座讲座。记住这一点，好的。现在的问题是下周：他在法国，所以他必须通过 Zoom 讲话。你们想在这里进行 Zoom 会议，还是想从那边（家里）参加？我也可以在 Zoom 讲座之后在家里连接我的讲座。
    我爱你们。如果是我的另一个学期，我会说……“Zoom”。他们甚至不会问“你更喜欢什么？”他们会自动说“Zoom”。你们中有多少人更喜欢下周全程 Zoom？你们中有多少人想在这里见到我？我不相信你们，但这家伙很好。他在休息前来看我：“你还好吧？”因为我给了我丈夫的电话号码[说]“如果我出了什么事，给我丈夫打电话。”所以很少有人选择在课堂上，所以我们将进行 Zoom 讲座，好吗？我们会先听 Renee 的，然后我在 Zoom 上讲课。我们会涵盖剩下的内容。
    但现在回到我们要开始的地方。至少现在你能回答这个问题了吗？所以如果你要发起 [TI]，你会做的第一步是什么？去寻找信息。对你的公司是什么有个概念？我该怎么做？首先是那个。然后是“什么结构会行得通？什么结构行不通？”我如何为此寻找来源，然后把大家聚在一起，得出那个问题？你要研究的问题是什么？然后是寻找信息，以及你是否整合了等等，等等，等等。你们提到的所有都是[其中的一部分]，但在任何事情之前必须发生更高层次的事情……除了领域[专家]，她在第一轮赢了。她总是从上面看，对吧？当她能描绘出那个时，清楚了吗？所以这就是你在公司开始 TI 活动的方式，理解组织。
    如果有任何问题，我会在这里。休息期间有一个问题。好的，开始写你们的 Logbook，如果你有任何想看反馈的问题，继续发给我。这就是它的运作方式，因为截止日期在最后，请提交 **一个文件**，其中包含所有的周。不要提交 5 个不同的文件。用你的学号命名你的文件。我的工作方式，上学期上过我课的人知道：如果你在写 Logbook，发给我。我会给你反馈以改进。你可以开始在上面构建，不要把所有的逻辑[草稿]都发给我……这就像把你的分数送人，对吧？别那样做。给反馈，在上面工作，然后就可以了。就是这样。如果你完成了 Logbook 并且在课堂上参与，60% 的评分就完成了。那是最终项目，对吧？所以尽量完成所有事情。
    下周我会给，我会给一篇无聊的论文让你们读。我告诉过你们，对吧？我不会忘记的。你们读那篇无聊的论文。这将是一篇。好的，我会为那些上过 **MT5007** 的人提一下。记得我提过标准作业（Standard Work）是必修的 Logbook 文章之一吗？你能相信尽管我在课堂上讲了一百万次，我仍然收到至少 5 份没有标准作业的提交吗？好的，不要重复这个。我不认为所有学生都在这里，但如果你在听我说，我希望如此。所以我希望你们都读那篇特别无聊的论文，你们有两周的时间读，但在下周之后实际上是三周，接下来的几周我看不到你们。所以读它，我很确定你无法一次读完。那篇论文……你会看到浏览器睡着了。所以再读一遍。
    我想要从论文中得到的是：**尝试以思维导图（Mind Map）或框图或图片的形式综合论文的关键信息。** 这就是分析师所做的。读无聊透顶的东西，从中提取有价值的信息，并以图形形式呈现。这将是每个人都要做的一个必修 Logbook [条目]。对于那些不在这里的人，有一个……对于那些在睡觉的人，后排醒醒，还有没在听我说话的人：每个人在 Logbook 提交中都应该有一个必修的 Logbook，那就是读我给的那篇无聊的论文。我不会叫它无聊的论文。它是一篇非常有价值的论文。那是作者的名字……**Lichtenthaler**。论文并综合有价值的……不，你需要知道什么是有价值的，什么是没价值的。这也必须重要，好的。什么是最有价值的信息？把它拉出来，以非常简洁、结构化的思维导图或图形形式呈现。对此有任何疑问吗？因为下周我不能当面讲这个。我在告诉你们，给出所有的……有任何疑问吗？现在问。
    *学生：* 是什么论文？
    *教授：* 如果你想……如果你认为你已经给出了足够的……我知道那篇论文，所以我知道她已经涵盖了足够的信息，但如果你认为某些章节你觉得重要，或者如果你遗漏了某些东西因为你觉得它不重要，你可以写。但不应该……没必要。你的 Logbook 没有固定的格式。我不会限制你说只能写这么多页。随意，因为那是为了测试你有多创新。创新不应该被限制在某一点之外。这就是为什么我不限制。是的，试图购买技术。
    *学生：* 是的，我想是这样，但我需要去……因为他写了 2 篇我用的论文。一篇是关于被动学习的，那是他的游戏。我会让你……
    *教授：* 我们刚刚做了那个。我需要找出来，因为有几位欧洲作者。它是 **Lichtenthaler** 写的，我就知道这么多。我会告诉你们，因为我不……所以那是唯一必修的。那是唯一必修的，好的。它就在那个东西上，只是有两篇论文。我不想搞混了。我去下一节课后会告诉你们。还有别的吗，说出来。

## Week 4
  Week 4 lecture preparation
  Dear all

  I will cover concepts of intelligence activities structured and managed within an organization next week. There are many papers referred to on Canvas. But you do not need to go through all of them. Just skim this article about technology intelligence practices in companies. It’s a descriptive article, which will help you relate what happens in practice to what I will cover in theory next week.

# Discussion
## Week 4
  During my time as an Algorithm Engineer, our Technology Intelligence (TI) activities mainly focused on **Targeting and Scanning**. This includes many kinds of SOTA architectures we can provide toour customers, like recent LLM models, Stable Diffusion and acceleration techniques (e.g., quantization, speculative decoding).

  **How we captured impact:**
  We focused on **technical performance metrics** firstly,instead of direct economic valuation in the short term. For achieving this, We used strict technical benchmarks. For example, when porting a PyTorch model to our inference framework, the KPIs were **inference latency** (ms), **throughput** (tokens/sec), and **accuracy retention** (ensuring loss < 1% after quantization). In the long-term, the value was actually valued by the **enablement of hardware ecosystems**. By successfully optimizing these models, we ensured our hardware remained competitive against our competitors.

  **Who conducted the assessment:**
  We have a team, which is normally 2-3 people, specifically investigating new technologies, and validated by out project leaders or higher level discussion meetings. So it's both a bottom-up and top-down process.

  **Suggestions for Improvement:**
  While our technical KPIs were precise, we lacked a direct link to **economic KPIs** during the R&D phase. Sometimes we need to go to customers' site for further debugging of their issues, and it could be a better opportunity for understanding their pain points, but it's not very frequently.
  An improvement would be talk and hear directly from customers, This would help engineering teams better visualize the business value of the intelligence activity beyond just "beating the benchmark."

# Syllabus
## Course Description
  Successful R&D engineers and managers should have the foresight to anticipate and drive technological changes and convert them into strategic assets to organizations. This course will equip students with technology forecasting, intelligence and foresighting skills, make use of the foresight to generate strategic intellectual assets and realize value from them to succeed in competitive environment. Effective collection and transformation of information into intelligence requires awareness of enterprise niches and alternatives, as well as the search and analytical skills of data and information. The course will emphasize these skills and impart a thorough understanding business & technology related strategic frameworks.
## Welcome to the course!
  Welcome to MT5010!

  I am Annapoornima Subramanian, lecturer for MT5010 for this semester.

  We all know that organizations need to develop insights into future alternatives and be relevant in order to enjoy sustained competitive advantage. Doing so is more critical for R&D intensive organizations as firms in high-technology industries are constantly threatened with technological discontinuities. Therefore, this module aims to equip students with strategic insights and analytical skills of technology forecasting & intelligence that are essential for high-tech companies to survive in a transient and competitive environment. Effective technological intelligence and forecasting requires a comprehensive awareness of enterprise niches and alternatives, analytical skills of data/information, knowledge management and considerations to organizational structures. Hence, this module covers range of topics including technology intelligence (a) mission (b) structure (c) processes, (d) management, and (e) tools.  Thus, apart from introducing the theory and practice of technology forecasting & intelligence, the module will provide hands-on training on technology intelligence and forecasting tools.
## Grading Components & Details
  The grading requirement involves both individual and group work. Individual work includes class participation, and a logbook submission. Group work includes a group project (either of a company of your choice or Straumann/NRP cases provided in Canvas).

  The breakdown of grading components is as follows

  Grading

  Individual Component (60%)

  Class Participation 30%
  Logbook  (26 April, 9pm) 30%
  Group Component (40%)

  Description

  Individual Component

  Class Participation (30% grade): Students are expected to analyze the readings and cases and contribute to class discussion. You are graded on quality rather than quantity. I will be inviting many guest lecturers for this module. Asking interesting questions during the guest lectures is a way to improve your class participation score.

  Logbook (30% grade): Throughout the semester, I will assign articles for discussion in each class and facilitate group activities. You are required to maintain a logbook that documents the discussion components from each session. Students who have taken MT5007 may already be familiar with this requirement; for those who haven't, I will provide a detailed briefing during the first lecture.

  Your logbook should focus on capturing the key discussion points from each class and connecting these insights to real-world applications. You need to cover a maximum of five topics in your logbook. The submission deadline is April 26, 2026.

  Group Component

  Group Project (40% grade)  Students are expected to form groups by themselves. Groups are expected to make a presentation and it can take one of the following two forms. Please note that there is no need to submit report. Just presentation is enough and slides are to be submitted to Canvas. Each group will have to make a presentation for 15-18 mins. This will be followed by Q&A for 2 mins.

  Technology Intelligence practices in your organization/If you were to initiate Technology Intelligence activities in your organization, how would you go about structuring and executing them.
  Presentation on Technological Intelligence Activities in a SME called Straumann. This case is published in a book. Groups need to understand the TI journey of Straumann and present their critical analysis of the same.
