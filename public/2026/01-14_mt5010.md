Week 2 lecture preparation

Lecture Notes for Week 2 will be uploaded after the lecture.

I usually upload lecture notes the day before the actual lecture. But I wouldn't be doing so today, as it will give away the answers to the challenge for the week. So I will upload the notes after the actual lecture. For tomorrow, please review the benchmarking report, bearing the posted questions in mind, and come prepared.

The guest lecture will be in class by 6.15 pm. I will just do a quick summary of last week's topics before his arrival. So please try to be on time.

Please go through the benchmarking report `Week2_CorporateForesight_BenchmarkingReport_Rene.pdf` before next week's lecture. Mr. Koo Seng Meng from AISG will be giving a guest lecture next week, starting 6.15 pm. Interesting questions raised during guest lecturers contribute to classroom participation marks.

You may focus on these questions as you review the report.

# Lectures
## Week 1
  - **00:00 – 02:46: Introduction to Foresighting Tools and Reading Load**

    ...tons and tons of things. Read doesn't mean you have to understand everything and imbibe everything. You need to give a cursory look and get the bigger picture, and see what is the important aspect of it. If it's relevant, you note it down. And it's only later on you're going to dive deep into techniques. Okay? If you look at—many of you mentioned about forecasting—if you look at forecasting tools, there are dozens of tools, techniques, and analysis available. If you expect a module to teach you everything, no one can do justice. So, what I'm here to do is to expose you to different techniques, okay, and what are the advantages and disadvantages. If you think at some point, for example, I will talk about qualitative techniques, I'll talk about quantitative techniques. In qualitative techniques, there are a few which I will give you an idea of how it is done. The reason is when you are expected to do that particular one, you have to dive deep to do that particular one. Because not all techniques are suited for all kinds of scenarios. So, I'll give you the breadth of the knowledge, and then you have to pick it up along the way. That's what this module is. So, you'll have to read, as a foresighting officer, as an intelligence officer, you need to read tons and tons of boring, drowsy—trust me, I'll ensure that I'll give at least a couple of articles which will put you to sleep. Because when I read the module, I had to read it three, four times because every time I started off, it put me to sleep. But that is the dirty job of an intelligence officer. Okay? You need to look for what is called as "gray information." You need to look for white spaces. And to get those white spaces, you need to dig into articles and identify the gem from there. That's valuable for your organization because if you look for very obvious clues that are out there—like he said, right, "I read news articles to know what is happening in the industry." By the time it comes as news articles, what happens? If you are a company, they're going to pick signals from there. You're already too late. You're not going to win the race.

    ……成千上万的东西。阅读并不意味着你必须理解所有内容并全盘吸收。你需要粗略地浏览，了解大局，看看其中重要的方面是什么。如果相关，你就记下来。只有在后来你才会深入研究具体技术。好吗？如果你看——你们很多人提到了预测——如果你看预测工具，有几十种工具、技术和分析方法可用。如果你期望一个模块能教会你一切，那是无法做到的。所以，我在这里要做的是让你们接触不同的技术，好吗，以及它们的优缺点是什么。比如，我会谈论定性技术，我会谈论定量技术。在定性技术中，我会向你们介绍其中几种是如何操作的。原因是当你被期望使用某种特定技术时，你必须深入研究才能掌握它。因为并不是所有的技术都适合所有类型的场景。所以，我会给你们知识的广度，然后你们必须在过程中自己掌握它。这就是这门模块的内容。所以，作为一名预见官员，作为一名情报官员，你需要阅读成千上万无聊、令人昏昏欲睡的东西——相信我，我会确保给你们几篇会让你们睡着的文章。因为当我备课时，我不得不读了三四遍，因为每次我开始读的时候，它都让我睡着了。但这正是情报官员的苦差事。好吗？你需要寻找所谓的“灰色信息”。你需要寻找空白领域。为了找到那些空白领域，你需要深入挖掘文章并从中识别出精华。这对你的组织很有价值，因为如果你只寻找外面非常明显的线索——就像他说的，“我阅读新闻文章来了解行业发生了什么。”等到它成为新闻文章时，会发生什么？如果你是一家公司，竞争对手也会从那里获取信号。你已经太晚了。你赢不了这场比赛。

  - **02:46 – 05:32: The Three Types of Intelligence Information (White, Gray, Black)**

    So, the smartness lies in, before it becomes a news article, you become the news article. For that, you need to do the dirty job of digging into dirty paperworks, and sometimes, in intelligence, there is something called—there are three kinds of information. One is white, the other one is gray, the third one is black. White information are published informations like news articles, patents, publications, everything, right? And even products sometimes. Gray information are information that you collect from talking to experts. You're hand-collecting data, right? You talk to them, you ask them, "Hey, what do you think the industry will be five years down the line?" And many of the articles on foresighting that is written is as an outcome of talking to experts like that. Since you collect the data talking to experts, they are called gray information. And there is something called black. Which is... What is black information? What is black money? Something like that. What is black information?

    Student: Dirty money?

    Professor: Dirty money. Likewise, dirty information. How do you get it?

    Student: Illegal.

    Professor: Like what? Like how?

    Student: Insider trading.

    Professor: Insider trading... which is one possible ways. Some industries, especially in the pharmaceutical industry—I don't know if I've shared with MT5004 folks—what they do is, one chemical company, pharmaceutical company, they will look into the trash cans of their competitor company because there could be wealth in the trash can which they shred and put. They go dig in and find some information out of it. Sometimes they hijack people from one company to another, which is very frequently happening in tech companies. All these come under black information. If you want to be in the forefront of innovation—don't go and tell this professor is propagating something illegal, okay? But I'm just saying what is happening in the industry, right? So, if you want to be in the forefront of innovation, people look for all kinds of information, and you can't wait for neatly published thing and then go and look into it to make your company decision. That's not going to work. So, in the process of teaching you how nasty it is, I will also make you read some nasty articles. If you're not ready for it, good for me. Drop the module. Right?

    所以，聪明之处在于，在它成为新闻文章之前，你先成为新闻。为此，你需要做深入挖掘繁琐文件的苦差事，有时，在情报中，有三种信息。一种是白色，另一种是灰色，第三种是黑色。白色信息是公开的信息，如新闻文章、专利、出版物，所有这些，对吧？有时甚至包括产品。灰色信息是你通过与专家交谈收集的信息。你在手动收集数据，对吧？你和他们交谈，问他们，“嘿，你认为五年后的行业会是什么样？”许多关于预见性的文章都是与此类专家交谈的结果。因为数据是你通过与专家交谈收集的，所以它们被称为灰色信息。还有一种叫做黑色信息。那是……什么是黑色信息？什么是黑钱？类似那样的。什么是黑色信息？

    学生：脏钱？

    教授：脏钱。同样地，脏信息。你怎么得到它？

    学生：非法手段。

    教授：比如什么？怎么做？

    学生：内幕交易。

    教授：内幕交易……这是一种可能的方式。一些行业，特别是在制药行业——我不知道我是否与MT5004的同学分享过——他们做的是，一家化学公司或制药公司，会去翻竞争对手公司的垃圾桶，因为垃圾桶里可能有被粉碎掉的财富。他们去挖掘并从中找到一些信息。有时他们从一家公司挖角人才到另一家公司，这在科技公司经常发生。所有这些都属于黑色信息。如果你想处于创新的前沿——不要去说这个教授在宣传非法的东西，好吗？但我只是说行业中正在发生什么，对吧？所以，如果你想处于创新的前沿，人们会寻找各种信息，你不能等待整齐发表的东西，然后再去研究它来做公司决策。那是行不通的。所以，在教你们这行有多残酷的过程中，我也会让你们读一些枯燥的文章。如果你还没准备好，那对我很好。退课吧。对吧？

  - **05:32 – 08:20: Presentation Skills and Class Expectations**

    Then the second thing. When it comes to this module, I, as decision makers, you know that they are time-pressed. They are not going to read your 10 pages or 20 pages report. Whatever intelligence you gather, you should be able to summarize it in a neat pictorial form to them. One example is we already have in this... here. Big Data Analytics. This is a report created for decision makers which involved months and months of efforts. And every block out there will tell the decision makers who are the companies there, whom I know, whom I do not know, what kind of technologies are there, what kind of agencies are there that I need to tap into for my funding, and everything. So, every outcome as an intelligence officer, you need to present it in a very concise, pictorial form like this to your bosses. So that when they give a cursory look, they kind of get the bigger picture, and they want to dive deep into certain things, they will ask you and you will give tons of documents related to it later on. But your first presentation has to be like this. So, many of the presentations which you do for this module will not be in the form of write-up, blah, blah, blah. It will be in the form of giving in form of mind map, pictures, road map, whatever you can think of in pictorial form because that's going to train you to be an analyst at some point, right? Because you can't give... You need to have reports written down, but that you can anyway do. You have ChatGPT, blah, blah, blah, right? But what you need to do is present all the information. There are some homeworks wherein I'll give you to read an article which is very boring and take the gist of it and present it in this form as well. That will assess you on whether you're able to pick gems out of rubbish and then present it in a form that is palatable to the decision makers who are time-pressed. Make sense to you? If you think you're not up to it, again, drop the module. Okay? So, this is what you can expect from the module. You may have to read. You may have to present, be able to present. And I will have forum discussion. I don't take attendance for this module, unlike 5007. And I'll make the webcast available as well. If you're here, I want you to be here. You get what I mean? Participate in class discussion. Don't be busy with your Snapchat, blah, blah, blah. If you're here, be here. And engage in a lot of group activities because you need to inevitably work with groups. And today also, I want you to work as a group on a topic. You know, you will be forced to think and work like consultants in this module. There will be a lot of group activity.



    然后是第二件事。说到这个模块，作为决策者，你们知道他们时间紧迫。他们不会读你的10页或20页报告。无论你收集什么情报，你都应该能够以整洁的图示形式向他们总结。这里就有一个例子：大数据分析（Big Data Analytics）。这是一份为决策者创建的报告，涉及数月的努力。那里的每一个区块都会告诉决策者那是谁的公司，我认识谁，我不认识谁，有什么样的技术，有什么样的机构是我需要利用来获取资金的，以及一切。所以，作为一名情报官员的每一个成果，你都需要像这样以非常简洁、图示的形式呈现给你的老板。这样当他们粗略一看，就能了解大局，而当他们想深入研究某些事情时，他们会问你，然后你再给他们成吨的相关文件。但你的第一次演示必须是这样的。所以，你们为这个模块做的许多演示不会是以书面形式，巴拉巴拉巴拉。它将是以思维导图、图片、路线图的形式，无论你能想到的什么图示形式，因为那将训练你成为一名分析师，对吧？因为你不能给……你需要有写下来的报告，但无论如何你都能做到。你有ChatGPT，巴拉巴拉，对吧？但你需要做的是呈现所有信息。会有一些作业，我会让你们读一篇非常无聊的文章，提取它的要点，并以这种形式呈现。那将评估你是否能够从垃圾中挑选宝石，然后以一种时间紧迫的决策者可以接受的形式呈现出来。这有道理吗？如果你认为你做不到，再次强调，退课。好吗？所以，这就是你可以从这个模块期待的。你可能需要阅读。你可能需要演示，能够演示。我会进行论坛讨论。我不像5007那样这门课点名。我也会提供网络直播。如果你人在这里，我希望你的心也在这里。你明白我的意思吗？参与课堂讨论。不要忙于你的Snapchat，巴拉巴拉。如果你在这里，就在这里。并参与很多小组活动，因为你不可避免地需要与小组合作。今天也是，我希望你们作为一个小组在一个话题上工作。你知道，在这个模块中，你将被迫像顾问一样思考和工作。会有很多小组活动。

  - **08:20 – 10:00: Carlson's Article and Logbook Requirements**

    And to make it, I dropped an email saying that there is an interesting activity. We will, at the end of this class, know about what is intelligence and foresighting and how do you go about doing it using Carlson's article. How many of you managed to go through Carlson's article? Please raise your hand. Okay. Sizable number, though not all. Okay, if you're expected to read an article, please read it because we'll have lots of discussion. I won't be spoon-feeding the module... or the papers in class, okay? It's good to rush through. And I told you that there will be an interesting challenge—that's why I asked you to go through. And in this class, there is going to be class participation grade, 30% , and there is going to be what is called as Logbook. Uh, for those who have done 5007, you know what a logbook is. For those who are not, what is a logbook? Logbook basically, if you take this particular week, you will take the topic of what is intelligence and foresighting and all. That's the core message from this week, right? So you can maintain a logbook of whatever we covered in class. There are three levels to logbook. The first level is what is intelligence, what is foresighting, whatever we discussed in class, you can write it. That is Level 1 logbook. And Level 2 logbook is whatever we covered in class, if you can relate it to your examples or workplace or experiences, whatever you encountered in life, "Okay, I did this kind of foresighting and this is what we did." And if you explain about your experience-related aspects, that's Level 2. And Level 3 is...



    为了做到这一点，我发了一封邮件说有一个有趣的活动。在这节课结束时，我们将了解什么是情报和预见，以及如何使用Carlson的文章去做。你们中有多少人阅读了Carlson的文章？请举手。好的。人数相当可观，虽然不是全部。好的，如果要求你们阅读一篇文章，请阅读它，因为我们会有很多讨论。我不会在课堂上填鸭式地教模块内容……或论文，好吗？快速浏览是好的。我告诉过你们会有一个有趣的挑战——这就是为什么我让你们去阅读。在这节课中，将会有课堂参与成绩，占30% ，还有一个叫做日志（Logbook）的东西 。呃，对于那些修过5007的人，你们知道什么是日志。对于那些没修过的，什么是日志？日志基本上，如果你拿这周来说，你会记录什么是情报和预见等主题。那是这周的核心信息，对吧？所以你可以维护一个关于我们在课堂上涵盖的内容的日志。日志有三个级别。第一级是什么是情报，什么是预见，无论我们在课堂上讨论什么，你可以写下来。那是1级日志。2级日志是无论我们在课堂上涵盖什么，如果你能将其与你的例子、工作场所或生活经历联系起来，“好的，我做了这种预见，这就是我们所做的。”如果你解释关于你经验相关的方面，那是2级。3级是……

  - **10:00 – 12:45: Levels of Logbook and Forum Participation**

    ...If you did engage in intelligence activity or foresighting activity, you encountered certain problems, certain issues, and you learned certain things from it which is informative to others. That is... it's like questioning certain aspects, right? That will be Level 3 of logbook. So in this module, one of the deliverables at the end of the module is logbook, for which you need to maintain logbook for five weeks. Topics on five topics. It could be Week 1 to Week 5, you can finish it by mid-term break, everything. Or if not, we'll be covering a lot of tools in the second part of the module, you can do that as well because they are more hands-on tools. Okay? So you need to maintain the logbook for five weeks. And class participation, of course, is there, right? You can participate in class by throwing in your ideas, or you can also take it to Canvas forum, like MT5007. Last year when I maintained the forum, I got the feedback saying there are some people who use ChatGPT to put it there for the sake of number. They were people, I knew it. And there are people who use their own experience to contribute to forum, right? So what I've decided for this module is I'll have two categories of forum discussion: one which allows people to use ChatGPT and throw in the ideas because I know there are students without work experience. I don't want them to be put in any disadvantages position. So if they're using ChatGPT, use ChatGPT, but learn something out of it and post in the forum. Don't just copy-paste there, okay? And they are going to be very long and try to be short, not more than 100 words. Try to be as short as possible for ChatGPT folks. I'm going to open a separate thread for those who are not using ChatGPT so that it's fully based on their experience. Okay? So that the group is split. Of course you can learn from each other, but I don't want people who are using experience alone to be bombarded with ChatGPT messages. That's the intention of separating them. So the class participation is from class, which Changhong will be noting down, I'll be noting down on the quality, and in terms of forum also I'll be moderating it. I won't answer but I'll take interesting threads from there and discuss in class like last semester as well. That's what we'll do. So that is class participation. I'll talk about it later. But, yes, Li Tian?

    Student: Uh, for the discussion forum, will we receive different marks for the different...

    Professor: Of course, right? Someone based on experience will have a richer value than those based only on ChatGPT, right? Of course there'll be difference. Now, um, because there are many people who just copy-pasted it. And my only hope is that in the process of doing that, they would search something related to the topic. Something will spill over. That's my intention. So I don't want to stop them, right? But I don't want that group to bombard the other group. That's why I'm separating it. And it's totally based on the feedback that I received from last semester. I just came up with a method to separate it.

    ……如果你确实参与了情报活动或预见活动，你遇到了一些问题，一些挑战，并且你从中学习到了对他人有信息价值的东西。那是……这就像质疑某些方面，对吧？那将是3级日志。所以在这个模块中，模块结束时的交付成果之一是日志，你需要维护五周的日志。关于五个主题。可以是从第1周到第5周，你可以在期中休息前完成所有的。或者如果没有，我们将在模块的第二部分涵盖很多工具，你也可以做那个，因为它们更多是动手操作的工具。好吗？所以你需要维护五周的日志。当然还有课堂参与，对吧？你可以通过抛出你的想法来参与课堂，或者你也可以把它带到Canvas论坛，就像MT5007一样。去年当我维护论坛时，我收到了反馈说有些人使用ChatGPT为了凑数而发布内容。确实有人这样做，我知道。还有一些人利用他们自己的经验为论坛做贡献，对吧？所以我为这个模块决定的是，我将设两类论坛讨论：一类允许人们使用ChatGPT并抛出想法，因为我知道有些学生没有工作经验。我不希望他们处于任何劣势地位。所以如果他们使用ChatGPT，那就使用ChatGPT，但要从中学习一些东西并在论坛上发布。不要只是复制粘贴到那里，好吗？而且那会很长，尽量简短，不要超过100个字。对于ChatGPT用户，尽量简短。我将为那些不使用ChatGPT的人开设一个单独的帖子，这样它就完全基于他们的经验。好吗？这样小组就分开了。当然你们可以互相学习，我不希望那些仅依靠经验的人被ChatGPT的消息轰炸。这就是分开他们的意图。所以课堂参与是来自课堂的，Changhong会记录下来，我会记录质量，在论坛方面我也会主持。我不会回答，但我会从中挑选有趣的帖子并在课堂上讨论，就像上学期一样。这就是我们要做的。所以那就是课堂参与。我稍后再谈。但是，是的，Li Tian？

    学生：呃，关于讨论论坛，不同的……我们会得到不同的分数吗？

    教授：当然，对吧？基于经验的人会比那些仅基于ChatGPT的人有更丰富的价值，对吧？当然会有区别。现在，嗯，因为有很多人只是复制粘贴。我唯一的希望是，在这样做的过程中，他们会搜索一些与主题相关的东西。会有一些东西溢出。那是我的意图。所以我不想阻止他们，对吧？但我不想那一组轰炸另一组。这就是我把它们分开的原因。这完全是基于我上学期收到的反馈。我只是想出了一个方法来分开它。

  - **12:45 – 15:30: Challenge for the Day: Forecasting vs. Foresighting vs. Intelligence**

    Now, any questions on this? But what I'm going to do is, every class I'm going to ask... post a challenge for the day. This is the challenge for the day. And if the challenge has been answered by someone to my satisfaction, the person is free to go home. I would assume your logbook for that week is maintained. And you'll have full marks for the class participation for that week. Is that clear? But you need to answer it to my satisfaction. All right? Is that clear? So if you can... if you're up to the challenge...

    [Audio clip playing: Someone plan the business...]

    And if you answer it well, you have a free day with full marks. And you can in your logbook, you can say, "Week 1, I was exempted, I got full marks." You just put it there, I give you full marks. Up to it? Yeah? If you want to still be in the class, of course you're most welcome, but if you're done, you can leave. Okay. Today's challenge is this: What is foresighting and how is it different from forecasting and intelligence? That's the first question. If you... one of you said the title is interested me, right? Someone here. You said, it's forecasting, intelligence, foresighting. Name it, you see it. What is the difference? Anybody. Is the question clear? What is the difference between the three?

    It would help if you have a name board like that so that I can call out your name. So next class please have it like that, okay? Or if you have a piece of paper, just write down your name. So that I'm more familiar and it's easier for Changhong to note down as well.

    Student: I haven't really thought through, but... yeah...

    Professor: Just pass it round.

    Student: But here goes nothing.

    Professor: They will have a pen.

    Student: Okay, okay.

    Student: So I... I know that answer is not wholly correct but I just still want to give it a shot. So maybe like foresighting relates to more like... relies on... uh... relies more on your experiences and your expertise, but like forecasting and intelligence relates to more using data and your tactical... I mean like theoretical models to make the decision.

    Professor: Not exactly. You need to use experience for all three. That's why it's not correct. You use data even for forecasting. You use data for intelligence and you will of course use data for foresighting as well. Everything is data first. Yes? Uh... please tell your name so that Changhong can note down and then...

    现在，对此有什么问题吗？但我打算做的是，每节课我都要问……发布当天的挑战。这是今天的挑战。如果有人回答了这个挑战并且让我满意，这个人就可以自由回家了。我会假设你那周的日志已经维护好了。并且你将获得那周课堂参与的满分。清楚了吗？但你需要回答到让我满意。好吗？清楚了吗？所以如果你能……如果你准备好接受挑战……

    [播放音频片段：有人计划生意……]

    如果你回答得好，你就可以有一天自由时间并获得满分。你可以在你的日志里说，“第1周，我被豁免了，我得了满分。”你只需写在那里，我就给你满分。准备好了吗？是吗？如果你还想待在课堂上，当然非常欢迎，但如果你完成了，你可以离开。好的。今天的挑战是：什么是预见（Foresighting），它与预测（Forecasting）和情报（Intelligence）有什么不同？这是第一个问题。如果你们……你们中有人说标题引起了我的兴趣，对吧？这里的某人。你说，是预测、情报、预见。说出名字，你就看见了。有什么区别？任何人。问题清楚吗？这三者之间有什么区别？

    如果你有像那样的名牌会很有帮助，这样我就能叫出你的名字。所以下节课请那样做，好吗？或者如果你有一张纸，就写下你的名字。这样我就更熟悉了，Changhong也更容易记录下来。

    学生：我还没有真正想清楚，但是……是的……

    教授：把它传过去。

    学生：但这可能毫无结果。

    教授：他们会有笔的。

    学生：好的，好的。

    学生：所以我……我知道那个答案并不完全正确，但我还是想试一试。所以也许像预见更多地与……依赖于……呃……更多地依赖于你的经验和你的专业知识，但像预测和情报更多地与使用数据和你的战术……我是说像理论模型来做决定有关。

    教授：不完全是。你需要为这三者都使用经验。这就是为什么它不正确。你甚至为预测使用数据。你为情报使用数据，当然你也也会为预见使用数据。一切都是数据优先。是的？呃……请告诉你的名字，以便Changhong可以记录下来，然后……

  - **15:30 – 17:50: Student Attempts at Defining Forecasting vs. Foresighting**

    Student: My name is Long. So for foresight is what would likely happen, predict the future in my opinion. Forecast is more structured, how we anticipate and deal with... what's coming. Intelligence is based on what current information we have in order to... to deal and to be able to implement based on what information we have right now.

    Professor: Almost there. But not exactly there. Almost there. So you can go for half of the class. Yes?

    Student: Um... foresighting is based... you also look at the future and you also look at the current state, so it's also backward looking. While forecasting and intelligence is more just outward looking rather than inward looking as well.

    Professor: The forecasting is more looking backwards. Yes. It's opposite. Anyone else? Yeah?

    Student: Maybe intelligence is based on existing data. I mean current decision. Just forecasting is about predicting the future based on existing data also. Then foresighting is different... different outcomes so that experience and decision.

    Professor: Yeah. It's a refined form of his answer. Good. Yeah. Almost there. Yeah? I can say he's answered about 90%, you answered 80%. Yeah? Anyone else who wants to give it a shot building on what these people said?

    Okay. If you want to leave you can leave, the two of you. Okay.

    There is something called hindsight, insight, and foresight. Hindsight is based on past. Whatever you have done, whatever data you have got. So based on whatever you have got so far, you're going to see, extrapolate, what could be a potential future. Right? It's like if you have data points till here, you're predicting for one or two more data points. That's forecast.

    学生：我叫Long。所以在我看来，预见（Foresight）是可能会发生什么，预测未来。预测（Forecast）更有结构，我们如何预期和处理……即将到来的事情。情报（Intelligence）是基于我们目前拥有的信息，以便……根据我们现在拥有的信息来处理和实施。

    教授：差不多了。但不完全是。差不多了。所以你可以离开一半的课。是的？

    学生：嗯……预见是基于……你也看未来，你也看当前状态，所以它也是向后看的。而预测和情报更多是向外看，而不是向内看。

    教授：预测更多是向后看。是的。是相反的。还有其他人吗？是的？

    学生：也许情报是基于现有数据。我是说当前的决定。只是预测也是基于现有数据预测未来。然后预见是不同的……不同的结果，以便经验和决策。

    教授：是的。那是他答案的改进形式。很好。是的。差不多了。是的？我可以说他回答了大约90%，你回答了80%。是的？还有其他人想在他俩说的基础上试一试吗？

    好的。如果你们想离开，你们可以离开，你们两个。好的。

    有所谓的后见之明（Hindsight）、洞察力（Insight）和预见（Foresight）。后见之明是基于过去的。无论你做了什么，无论你得到了什么数据。所以基于你目前得到的一切，你要看，外推，什么可能是潜在的未来。对吧？就像如果你有到这里的数据点，你在预测另外一两个数据点。那是预测（Forecast）。

  - **17:50 – 19:15: Defining Intelligence and Foresighting**

    When it comes to intelligence, like what he said and what he said, insight is all about currently I am looking at the trend. What is going on? Suddenly COVID hit. Right? It's an information that has come to you. And I act on that and I make my decisions. Okay, COVID has hit. My... I am in the service sector, I'm going to be hit. I'm going to revamp into something else. So that is intelligence. Based on the current data which I am getting, I am doing some analysis, gathering some intelligence, and then making decisions based on it. But when it comes to foresighting, it's very futuristic. Five years down the line...

    当谈到情报（Intelligence）时，就像他说的和他说的，洞察力（Insight）完全是关于我现在正在看趋势。正在发生什么？突然COVID来袭。对吧？这是一个传给你的信息。我据此采取行动并做出决定。好的，COVID来袭了。我的……我在服务行业，我将受到打击。我要改造成别的东西。所以那就是情报。基于我目前得到的当前数据，我正在做一些分析，收集一些情报，然后据此做出决定。但是当谈到预见（Foresighting）时，它是非常未来主义的。五年后……

  - **19:15 – 22:30: Hindsight, Insight, and Foresighting Explained**

    ...Five years down the line, ten years down the line. Bear in mind, for many of you who shared your ideas on why you are in this class, five years down the line, ten years down the line, when it comes to foresighting, you are not here to predict exactly "this is what is going to happen." If you were to do it, you're doing wrong foresight. Okay? Five years down the line, ten years down the line, future could be like this, or like this, or like this, or like this. You come up with or you paint different scenarios of the future. Right? And what you do today is, if one of those futures were to come into reality, how am I going to prepare myself to navigate through, rather than being thrown out of it. You get what I mean? So let's break it down to your personal life. Okay. Tomorrow if I ask you, what is your day going to be like, Karishma?

    Student: I'll do another module at the same time.

    Professor: You'll wake up and you whatever your day job is, you'll do and then you'll be here for the class. But if I ask you like a few months down the line, will you be able to say?

    Student: Not so accurately.

    Professor: Yeah. Especially if I ask you about your summer. In June, on June 15th, what are you going to do?

    Student: Oh, my mom has plans to go to India, while my father has plans to go to Europe.

    Professor: Whatever, right? If that were to happen, how do I prepare myself today? If this were to happen, what do I do? If I'm going to look for jobs, what do I do? So future... or foresighting is all about what could be potential future, what could be one of the potential states—or there could be multiple states—and how I prepare myself to be there if one of the states were to happen. Right? And when you do that, even that is data-based. Because if you were to paint this scenario could happen, that scenario could happen, you need to collect a lot of data as well. What kind of data you will collect? You'll collect data about... if you're looking for a job. What kind of data you will collect to paint your future scenarios?

    You might even look at which countries are doing well. You might even closely watch Trump, what he's doing, so that you can avoid him neatly and look for elsewhere, right? And you might look at how technology... what is AI happening, is it becoming a fad or is it there to disrupt you? There is... this is one question which is haunting many people. Is AI there to remain or leave? Right? Many questions are hovering around that. When it comes to energy system, he said solar. Is it solar the way that we need to go or is it something else? Is it already maturing or is it saturated? That's one question that we will be looking at. There are other promising energy... you know, alternative energy that you can bet on. Right? So you need to collect data on many aspects as well. Everything is data-based. Not one is not... Now you understand the difference?

    ……五年之后，十年之后。请记住，对于你们许多分享了为什么在这个课堂上的想法的人来说，五年之后，十年之后，当谈到预见时，你不是在这里准确预测“这就是将会发生的事情”。如果你那样做，你就是在做错误的预见。好吗？五年之后，十年之后，未来可能像这样，或者像那样，或者像这样，或者像那样。你想出或者你描绘未来的不同场景。对吧？而你今天做的是，如果那些未来中的一个成为现实，我将如何准备自己去驾驭它，而不是被甩出去。你明白我的意思吗？所以让我们把它分解到你的个人生活中。好的。如果明天我问你，Karishma，你的一天会是什么样？

    学生：我会在同一时间做另一个模块。

    教授：你会醒来，无论你的日常工作是什么，你会做，然后你会来这里上课。但是如果我问你几个月后的事情，你能说出来吗？

    学生：没那么准确。

    教授：是的。特别是如果我问你关于你的夏天。在六月，六月十五号，你要做什么？

    学生：噢，我妈妈计划去印度，而我爸爸计划去欧洲。

    教授：无论怎样，对吧？如果那要发生，我今天如何准备自己？如果这要发生，我做什么？如果我要找工作，我做什么？所以未来……或者预见完全是关于什么可能是潜在的未来，什么可能是潜在状态之一——或者可能有多种状态——如果其中一种状态发生，我如何准备自己去那里。对吧？当你那样做时，即使那是基于数据的。因为如果你要描绘这个场景可能发生，那个场景可能发生，你也需要收集大量数据。你会收集什么样的数据？你会收集关于……如果你在找工作。你会收集什么样的数据来描绘你的未来场景？

    你甚至可能会看哪些国家做得好。你甚至可能会密切关注特朗普，他在做什么，这样你可以巧妙地避开他去别处寻找，对吧？你可能会看技术如何……AI发生了什么，它是变成一种时尚还是要颠覆你？这是……这是一个困扰许多人的问题。AI是留下来还是离开？对吧？许多问题都在那周围盘旋。当谈到能源系统时，他说太阳能。太阳能是我们需要的方向还是别的什么？它已经成熟了还是饱和了？那是我们将要看的一个问题。还有其他有前途的能源……你知道，你可以押注的替代能源。对吧？所以你也需要在许多方面收集数据。一切都是基于数据的。没有一个不是……现在你明白区别了吗？

  - **22:30 – 26:10: Evolution from Forecasting to Intelligence to Foresighting**

    In the earlier days, people only talked about forecasting. With whatever data they got, they tried to extrapolate for one, two years down the line. It was fine in older days because technology wasn't... or the environment wasn't... wasn't moving so fast, so dramatic. So forecasting was enough. And intelligence is something which many of the top-notch companies in innovation engage in. Because as soon as clues come, you change your business model. You change your customer... the way the customers... For example, right, when... when there was a time when people in the retail sector thought, okay, festive season, Chinese New Year is coming. Which means what? Stock up all your products because there is going to be huge sales, right? But it's not... over time they realized that it's not just festive means more sales, it is also festive season together with people's mindset. Right? If people are very uncertain about their jobs, though it's Chinese New Year, do you think they're going to spend more? Right? So it is not just about festive season, it's about broader socio-economic context also that plays a role in your business. So they started doing intelligent decisions in order to be more agile in the marketplace. That is intelligence. But then they realized all this is not enough, we need to think about... if you want to be in the forefront of innovation, you cannot be always reactive. Oh, this happened today, so I'm reacting to it. This happened today, I'm reacting to that. That cannot be the way if you want to be in the forefront of innovation. So what you do is you want to be the driver of the whole thing. Which means what? You want to see in the future what could be the potential things and then you want to take decisions today so that you are not taken by surprise. You're not thrown out of the business. That's what is foresighting. Yes, Moammar?

    Student: Um, just a query regarding all of this. What we are doing... we'll look at what technologies will be the future... or particular technologies... I mean, not particular technologies but what will be the future technology, but will we take a particular technology and look at how that... the future of that technology will be? For example, since I'm looking at solar, I'm looking at the past two years how the price has drastically dropped from where it was. So something like that also... a particular technology and how the forecast of that technology.

    Professor: There are different levels to foresighting. That's what you would have seen in Carlson's article as well. If you are working on one particular technology or if you are like her, R&D, making R&D decisions. For example, you are investing in solar, you are investing in wind or you are investing in geothermal, right? You want to... you have been investing in solar all along. And now you think, is this the right strategy or not? Then you dive deeper in solar, but you also look at competitor technology and analyze whether it's better for me to invest... continue investing here or invest there. So that is one level wherein within a business unit you are looking at this particular technology. That is one level. But foresighting spans different levels. As I said earlier, it could be a small R&D group, it could be an organization, it could be an industry, it could be a country. That's why this topic is applicable to all levels starting from individuals. That's why I said even if you don't apply the techniques for your company, all the techniques could be applied for the individual level as well, including Knowledge Management. Okay? So the focus can be different. The techniques that you learn will be applicable with cover breadth of it. Good question. Anything else?

    在早期，人们只谈论预测。用他们得到的任何数据，他们试图外推未来一两年。在过去那是可以的，因为技术没有……或者环境没有……没有移动得那么快，那么剧烈。所以预测就足够了。而情报是许多顶尖创新公司从事的事情。因为一旦线索出现，你就改变你的商业模式。你改变你的客户……客户的方式……例如，对吧，当……曾经有一段时间，零售行业的人认为，好的，节日季节，农历新年快到了。这意味着什么？囤积你所有的产品，因为将会有巨大的销售，对吧？但这不仅仅是……随着时间的推移，他们意识到不仅仅是节日意味着更多的销售，也是节日季节加上人们的心态。对吧？如果人们对他们的工作非常不确定，即使是农历新年，你认为他们会花更多钱吗？对吧？所以这不仅仅是关于节日季节，更广泛的社会经济背景也在你的业务中发挥作用。所以他们开始做智能决策，以便在市场上更加敏捷。那就是情报。但后来他们意识到所有这些是不够的，我们需要考虑……如果你想处于创新的前沿，你不能总是被动的。噢，今天发生了这件事，所以我对此做出反应。今天发生了这件事，我对此做出反应。如果你想处于创新的前沿，那不能是方式。所以你要做的是你想成为整件事的驱动者。这意味着什么？你想在未来看到什么可能是潜在的事情，然后你想在今天做出决定，这样你就不会措手不及。你不会被踢出局。那就是预见。是的，Moammar？

    学生：嗯，只是关于所有这些的一个疑问。我们在做的……我们会看什么技术将是未来……或者特定技术……我是说，不是特定技术而是什么是未来技术，但我们会拿一个特定技术来看看那个……那个技术的未来会怎样吗？例如，因为我在看太阳能，我在看过去两年价格是如何从原来的水平急剧下降的。所以类似那样的……一个特定技术以及那个技术的预测。

    教授：预见有不同的层次。这也是你在Carlson的文章中会看到的。如果你在致力于某一项特定技术，或者如果你像她一样，研发，做研发决策。例如，你在投资太阳能，你在投资风能或者你在投资地热能，对吧？你想……你一直都在投资太阳能。现在你想，这是正确的策略吗？然后你深入研究太阳能，但你也看竞争对手的技术并分析对我来说是更好投资……继续在这里投资还是在那里投资。所以那是一个层次，在一个业务单元内你看这个特定的技术。那是一个层次。但预见跨越不同的层次。正如我之前说的，它可以是一个小的研发小组，它可以是一个组织，它可以是一个行业，它可以是一个国家。这就是为什么这个话题适用于从个人开始的所有层次。这就是为什么我说即使你不为你的公司应用这些技术，所有的技术也可以应用于个人层次，包括知识管理。好吗？所以重点可以是不同的。你学习的技术将适用并涵盖它的广度。好问题。还有别的吗？

  - **26:10 – 29:20: Different Levels of Foresighting Application**

    So that's why when I... when I heard you, there are people who talk at technology level. There are people who talk at R&D level. There are people who talk at country level as well. You know, especially those who are in... uh... you, Yi Chun and all, I don't know if you look at country level or industry level. For example, Singapore did something called Industry Transformation Roadmap. Right? This happened what, five years ago? Or six, seven years ago, maybe? It was done for every sector. Right? Every... know... every budget they invest in R&D, they always have... try to see, you know, which industries to bet on, which sectors to bet on. In fact, you know, one of the things which I wanted to share is that NRF is interested in training the civil servants in being futuristic. This is one of the modules which again Chai Kah Hin wants to take it up, right? They want to know what to bet on. So this is done at different levels. Uh... when I told you Koo Seng Meng will be coming next week for guest lecture, he was with NRF when he did this module. He was looking at the country level, right? For different sectors. So there are different people at different levels. Yeah. Any other question? Is this clear? The difference across three things?

    Now, the second thing. Your name, Eugene and Wasyatomo, is it? Noted down. Yeah. Good.

    所以这就是为什么当我……当我听到你们时，有些人是在技术层面上谈论。有些人是在研发层面上谈论。也有人是在国家层面上谈论。你知道，特别是那些在……呃……你，Yi Chun和其他人，我不知道你们是看国家层面还是行业层面。例如，新加坡做了一个叫做行业转型路线图（Industry Transformation Roadmap）的东西。对吧？这是发生在五年前？还是六七年前，也许？它是为每个部门做的。对吧？每一个……知道……他们投资于研发的每一笔预算，他们总是有……试图看，你知道，押注哪些行业，押注哪些部门。事实上，你知道，我想分享的一件事是NRF有兴趣培训公务员具有未来感。这是Chai Kah Hin再次想要接手的模块之一，对吧？他们想知道押注什么。所以这是在不同层面上完成的。呃……当我告诉你们Koo Seng Meng下周会来做客座讲座时，他做这个模块时是在NRF。他在看国家层面，对吧？针对不同的部门。所以在不同层面有不同的人。是的。还有其他问题吗？这个清楚了吗？这三者之间的区别？

    现在，第二件事。你的名字，Eugene和Wasyatomo，是吗？记下了。是的。很好。

  - **29:20 – 32:25: Carlson's Article Discussion and Class Participation Guidelines**

    Now, what Carlson's article say in terms of foresighting and the process and tools involved in it? We will talk in detail about this article, but I just want to give chance for those who really have done hard work to stand out in terms of class participation. Yes. Your name? When you write your name, can you make it bold? Moammar, yours is way too small. I can't see... Your is Jonan, is it?

    Student: Jonan, yeah.

    Professor: Jonan, yeah.

    Student: Uh so what I believe that Carlson said in this article was that... um mainly for foresighting it's a structured and strategic process that identifies and translates emerging technologies into future business opportunities. So his process mainly revolves around uh defining the power zone, then after that creating future options and strategy and R&D integration. And some of the tools he used are like his technology space map, which is basically to broadly classify the technologies of the future, and then after that he can he can better pump in your resources to do your R&D.

    Professor: Okay. So this is where I would want... Okay, maybe I should tell this after giving chance to others. Good. You're there. I would say 50%. Anyone else? Yes.

    Student: I think he laid out the process of doing so, like if you read it, you will say, okay, step one you should do this, do that, step two. And then he also laid out what are the key success metrics that would enable the process to be successful. So for example, that you need like a upper management support. Support. Yeah, support. So he laid out that I guess it won't get above the upper management to get it okay. So there's no point if you don't get the support, then if you do it at the lower level... I mean as what you said at the start, you say not all the tools will be useful in the real life because if you don't have the management support. So I think he laid out the key success metrics as well.

    Professor: Support. Good. Yeah? I would say it's all building on... right? He laid the foundation, she's building on it. Anyone else?

    Student: Apart from what Jonan and Lisa said...

    Professor: Lisa.

    Student: Yes, Lisa. Uh one thing that I really liked reading this article is the process of involving people from cross-functional uh parts of an organ... not only their own organization but industry experts uh consultants so that there's not a group think. So doing that with workshops and then going back to analysis and then bringing them all again as a convergent thinking. So, yeah, so the process was more I would say organized. If I'm working in an organization, it's it's easy to follow rather than it's it's not isolated like that.

    现在，Carlson的文章在预见（foresighting）以及其中涉及的过程和工具方面是怎么说的？我们将详细讨论这篇文章，但我只想给那些真正努力工作的人一个在课堂参与方面脱颖而出的机会。是的。你的名字？当你写名字时，能不能加粗？Moammar，你的太小了。我看不到……你是Jonan，是吗？

    学生：Jonan，是的。

    教授：Jonan，是的。

    学生：呃，所以我认为Carlson在这篇文章中所说的是……嗯，主要是对于预见，它是一个结构化和战略性的过程，识别并将新兴技术转化为未来的商业机会。所以他的过程主要围绕呃定义“力量区”（power zone），然后之后创建未来选项以及战略和研发整合。他使用的一些工具就像他的技术空间图（technology space map），这基本上是为了广泛分类未来的技术，然后之后他可以他可以更好地投入你的资源来做你的研发。

    教授：好的。这是我想要……好的，也许我应该在给其他人机会后再说这个。很好。你到了。我会说50%。还有其他人吗？是的。

    学生：我认为他列出了这样做的过程，就像如果你读它，你会说，好的，第一步你应该做这个，做那个，第二步。然后他还列出了使过程成功的关键成功指标是什么。例如，你需要像上层管理支持。支持。是的，支持。所以他列出了我想如果不得到上层管理的批准就不会通过。所以如果你得不到支持就没有意义，然后如果你在较低层级做……我是说就像你在开始时说的，你说并非所有的工具在现实生活中都有用，因为如果你没有管理层的支持。所以我认为他也列出了关键成功指标。

    教授：支持。很好。是的？我会说这都是建立在……对吧？他奠定了基础，她在其上构建。还有其他人吗？

    学生：除了Jonan和Lisa所说的……

    教授：Lisa。

    学生：是的，Lisa。呃，我真的很喜欢阅读这篇文章的一点是涉及来自组织跨职能……不仅仅是他们自己的组织，还有行业专家、顾问的过程，这样就没有群体思维。所以通过研讨会做那个，然后回到分析，然后再把他们都带回来作为一个趋同思维。所以，是的，所以这个过程更多我会说是有组织的。如果我在一个组织工作，这很容易遵循，而不是像那样孤立。

  - **32:25 – 35:20: Facilitation and Process Structure**

    Professor: So these decision makers are not working in silos saying, "Hey, I'm going to decide on this, go for it." No, that's not how it is done. If at all... Anyone else who wants to share in? Anything else?

    Student: Can I just...

    Professor: Yes.

    Student: Add on.

    Professor: And your name?

    Student: My name is Long. I like the mention about choosing the right facilitator. Yeah, the process facilitator. He has to be respected, subject matter expert at least, and able to bring people uh together, having that divergent and convergent thinking. And when to facilitate whatever process to ensure they achieve the entire business goals.

    Professor: Right. They play an important role. Yes. So in a nutshell, what they say is foresighting is all about carrying out a process. I want you to bear in mind. Foresighting is not about telling "this is what you can expect in future." Foresighting is about a process which enables a firm to be prepared for one of the possible futures. And how do you do it? This is how you do it. It is a structured process which involves many people. And it is aligned with the strategy of the company because what happens is, in a company, first the decision makers should think and value foresighting. In many organizations, it doesn't happen. They think, okay, we are running the show, what's a big deal? We are fine. They move on. Only to realize that something is coming as a shock to hit them. Okay, many companies, organizations unfortunately run that way, especially small and medium enterprises. They are worried about their current bread and butter. You can't expect them to be futuristic. That is why Singapore is very good in the sense they are expecting A*STAR and all to handhold these SMEs to say, "Hey, they cannot think about their future. You help them to prepare them for future." They conduct and handhold, run a workshop saying, "You're working in this, but future is there, you'll be thrown out of business, so try to change." And they do lot of programs to support them. If you're in a large organization, you have the luxury to engage in foresighting but not many bosses understand the value of it. We'll talk more about it in future. Because they think it is like wasting time. Trust me, you know, many of the foresighting activity and processes and workshops happen in a resort, in a spa, in a cool environment. Bringing in people. And they look at it as cost to the organization. They look at it... nothing tangible comes out of it. What is the KPI? What have you met? If they keep asking this question, you cannot exactly show. Unless you do due diligence. Next week we are going to look at how do you show the value of foresighting to your bosses to convince that this is very vital for your company, otherwise you'll be thrown out of business. Next week we look at it.

    教授：所以这些决策者不是在孤岛中工作说，“嘿，我要决定这个，去吧。”不，不是那样做的。如果有的话……还有其他人想分享吗？还有什么吗？

    学生：我能不能只是……

    教授：是的。

    学生：补充。

    教授：你的名字？

    学生：我叫Long。我喜欢关于选择合适的引导者（facilitator）的提及。是的，过程引导者。他必须受到尊重，至少是主题专家，并且能够把人们呃聚集在一起，拥有那种发散和趋同思维。以及何时引导任何过程以确保他们实现整个业务目标。

    教授：对。他们扮演着重要角色。是的。简而言之，他们说的是预见完全是关于执行一个过程。我要你们记住。预见不是关于告诉“这是你在未来可以期待的”。预见是关于一个使公司能够为可能的未来之一做好准备的过程。那你怎么做呢？这就是你怎么做的。它是一个涉及许多人的结构化过程。而且它与公司的战略一致，因为发生的情况是，在一个公司里，首先决策者应该思考并重视预见。在许多组织中，这并没有发生。他们认为，好的，我们在运营，有什么大不了的？我们要好。他们继续前进。直到意识到有什么东西作为一个冲击来打击他们。好的，许多公司、组织不幸是以那种方式运行的，特别是中小企业。他们担心他们目前的生计。你不能期望他们具有未来感。这就是为什么新加坡很好，在这个意义上他们期望A*STAR等等去扶持这些中小企业说，“嘿，他们不能考虑他们的未来。你帮助他们为未来做准备。”他们进行并扶持，举办研讨会说，“你们在这个领域工作，但未来在那里，你们会被踢出局，所以尝试改变。”他们做了很多项目来支持他们。如果你在一个大型组织中，你有奢侈去从事预见，但并不是很多老板理解它的价值。我们将来会更多地讨论它。因为他们认为这就像浪费时间。相信我，你知道，许多预见活动和过程以及研讨会发生在一个度假村，在一个水疗中心，在一个很酷的环境中。把人带进来。他们把它看作是对组织的成本。他们看它……没有什么有形的东西从中出来。KPI是什么？你达到了什么？如果他们一直问这个问题，你无法确切展示。除非你做尽职调查。下周我们将看看如何向你的老板展示预见的价值，以说服这对你的公司至关重要，否则你会被踢出局。下周我们看这个。

  - **35:20 – 38:00: The Power Zone and Workshop Methodology**

    So what you need to do is, the boss has to agree this is important, and engage in the process of calling people from diverse background, have a facilitator to moderate it who commands respect, and then goes through workshop. There are two workshops that Carlson's article mentions. And there are many tools like technology space matrix, the power zone centroid, everything. All these tools, trust me, I was working with a colleague for wind turbine on solar... you know, competitor, in laying out forecasting foresighting for them, and all we did was simple Excel sheet. You don't need fancy tools. You don't need large database and run analysis. Sometimes it is just a question of having simple Excel sheet, having a proper template of what you want, seeking opinion and analyzing it. That's good enough. And if you look at technology space matrix and all, these are all very subjective. Companies use different tools and techniques. That's why I said if I were to teach certain tools... if I were to spend all my energy today teaching about the the different tools used in Carlson's article, it's a waste of your time and my time. Because today it is this, tomorrow when you join a company they are going to use a different tool or you are going to devise a different one which is context specific for the company. So don't waste your time on tools going by... When I give you article, don't waste your time on understanding all the tools and techniques because you should be aware that such a tool exists. That's enough for this module. Okay, there is something called this, this is how it's broadly done. That's about it. Don't break your head on it. Okay? That's where you want to extrapolate the article. Look at what is more important than wasting your time in nitty-gritty details. Don't do that. You cannot afford to do that in technology intelligence unless you are doing the analysis job. An analyst? Yes, they need to worry about it. Okay? Now, what you need to do is as a boss and as you have called in a facilitator, you create an environment for people to come and meet, and they always start from where they are, what they are. That's where the power zone comes. What is that which defines me today? What are my core strengths? What are my capabilities? What are my assets? Okay? And then you this is also out of workshop, right? Because different people think the firm is defined as certain thing in different ways. For you, you might think you know this module is big good because it helps me in analyzing tools. He might think it's because it helps me in decision making, right? Different people have difference. That's why you come together to define what is my core. That's where the bosses also play a role with the strategic vision. Then once they define the current state... okay, if you look at me, me as a faculty, here I am, I'm a tenured professor at NUS, I'm good with teaching, my research and my services. That's me as my... the three pillars that I have. Right? Then at the end of the workshop, you carve out a nice neat question of where you want to go. Because if you were to be futuristic with an open-ended question, it's endless. Right? So that's where the bosses try to define or frame a question which is going to be the anchoring point...

    所以你需要做的是，老板必须同意这很重要，并参与召集来自不同背景的人的过程，让一位受人尊敬的引导者来主持，然后通过研讨会。Carlson的文章提到了两个研讨会。还有很多工具，如技术空间矩阵（technology space matrix）、力量区质心（power zone centroid）等等。所有这些工具，相信我，我和一位同事为风力涡轮机关于太阳能……你知道，竞争对手，为他们制定预测预见，我们所做的只是简单的Excel表格。你不需要花哨的工具。你不需要大型数据库和运行分析。有时这只是一个拥有简单Excel表格，拥有你想要的适当模板，寻求意见并分析它的问题。这就足够了。如果你看技术空间矩阵等等，这些都是非常主观的。公司使用不同的工具和技术。这就是为什么我说如果我要教某些工具……如果我今天要花所有的精力教关于Carlson文章中使用的不同工具，那是浪费你的时间和我的时间。因为今天它是这个，明天当你加入一家公司时，他们会使用不同的工具，或者你要设计一个针对公司具体情况的不同工具。所以不要把时间浪费在工具上……当我给你文章时，不要把时间浪费在理解所有的工具和技术上，因为你应该知道这种工具存在。这就足够这个模块了。好的，有这种东西，这是大概怎么做的。大概就是这样。不要在这上面伤脑筋。好吗？那是你想要外推文章的地方。看看什么比把时间浪费在细枝末节上更重要。不要那样做。除非你在做分析工作，否则你在技术情报中承担不起那样做。分析师？是的，他们需要担心这个。好吗？现在，你需要做的是作为老板，并且你已经叫来了一位引导者，你为人们创造一个环境来见面，他们总是从他们在哪里，他们是什么开始。这就是力量区（power zone）出现的地方。什么是今天定义我的东西？我的核心优势是什么？我的能力是什么？我的资产是什么？好吗？然后你这也是出于研讨会，对吧？因为不同的人认为公司以不同的方式被定义为某种东西。对于你，你可能认为你知道这个模块很好因为它帮助我分析工具。他可能认为这是因为它帮助我做决策，对吧？不同的人有差异。这就是为什么你们聚在一起来定义什么是我的核心。这就是老板们通过战略愿景也发挥作用的地方。然后一旦他们定义了当前状态……好的，如果你看我，我作为一个教员，我在这里，我是NUS的终身教授，我擅长教学，我的研究和我的服务。那是作为我的……我拥有的三个支柱。对吧？然后在研讨会结束时，你精心设计一个你想去哪里的漂亮简洁的问题。因为如果你要用一个开放式问题来展望未来，那是无止境的。对吧？所以这就是老板们试图定义或构建一个将成为锚点的问题的地方……

  - **38:00 - 39:29: Defining the Framework for Foresight**

    ...for that team to think about foresight. For example, this question will be: I have been betting on solar technology. Does it make sense for me to invest more in this as a company, or should I not? That could be a question for this company. For me, I have been doing teaching, research, and service as a tenured professor in NUS. Is it okay to continue in this trajectory, or is AI going to disrupt the whole industry so much that I need to completely revamp my skill set? That could be a framing question for me.

    So, at the end of the first workshop, you need to, as bosses, you need to define what is the framework which is going to define your foresight. If you leave it open-ended saying, "I want to be competitive five years down the line," it's too vague. Right? Or it could be what many of you mentioned about AI: Is AI going to disrupt my industry [such] that I need to quickly revamp my workforce on AI-related tools and techniques? That could be a broad question. Or is it a fad for my industry?

    ……讓那個團隊去思考前瞻性（Foresight）。例如，這個問題可能是：我一直押注於太陽能技術。作為一家公司，我是否有意義繼續在此投入更多資金，還是不應該？這可能是這家公司的一個問題。對我來說：作為新加坡國立大學（NUS）的終身教授，我一直從事教學、研究和服務工作。繼續沿著這個軌跡發展是可以的嗎？還是說人工智慧（AI）會徹底顛覆整個行業，以至於我需要完全重塑我的技能組合？這可能是我的一個框架性問題。

    因此，在第一次研討會結束時，作為老闆，你們需要定義將用來界定你們前瞻性工作的框架是什麼。如果你們留一個開放式的結尾，說“我想在五年後保持競爭力”，這太模糊了。對吧？或者它可以是你們許多人提到的關於 AI 的問題：AI 是否會顛覆我的行業，以至於我需要快速讓我的員工掌握 AI 相關的工具和技術？這可能是一個廣泛的問題。或者這對我的行業來說只是一時的熱潮？

  - **39:29 - 40:46: Gathering Data and Analyzing the Future**

    So you come up with a broad question and you ask these people to go and collect more data to analyze it, so that you can carve out potential future. Right? At least this particular article... it's more of an old article, but I'm telling you what this article says. It's not about carving the future; it's talking about three important decisions. What are the three important decisions? Based on the two workshops. The first workshop I already told you: what is your Power Zone. And then at the end of the thing, they are going to carve out and go and collect more data about the future.

    You're going to go and study... if you're in the education industry, what all data you will gather? Maybe let's do a group activity. I was planning for one. This is how I start the whole class: I decided to not use the slides today. I usually use slides, knowing me from [module] 5007, but today I thought I will grab your attention, I won't use the slide. So I'm just going through the whole lecture without the slides.

    所以你們提出一個廣泛的問題，然後要求這些人去收集更多的數據並進行分析，以便你們能夠描繪出潛在的未來。對吧？至少這篇特定的文章……這是一篇比較舊的文章，但我是在告訴你們這篇文章講了什麼。它不是關於描繪未來，而是討論了三個重要的決定。哪三個重要的決定？基於這兩次研討會。第一次研討會我已經告訴過你們了：你們的“實力區”（Power Zone）是什麼。然後在結束時，他們將制定計畫並去收集更多關於未來的數據。

    你們要去研究……如果你們在教育行業，你們會收集什麼數據？也許我們來做一個小組活動。我本來就計畫了一個。這就是我開始這堂課的方式：我今天決定不使用投影片。認識我（上過 5007 模組）的人都知道我通常會用投影片，但今天我想抓住你們的注意力，我不會用投影片。所以我將在沒有投影片的情況下講完整堂課。

  - **40:46 - 43:07: The Classroom Activity: NUS in 2032**

    So let's do one thing, let's take a break and do this class activity. The class activity... hopefully you all form a group by then. For this module, let's have a group of say five to six members. And you need not stick to the same group for your group project. Of course, group project is there, you have to have a group, but today you can form any group that you want. See if you are in synergy with the groupmates. So form a group of five to six members, and I want you to do this activity after the break.

    Wherein you are going to be hired by Prof Tan, our President of NUS, and he is going to say... he is going to frame you this question: "What kind of classrooms should NUS have in 2032?" You as intelligence officers/analysts, you are going to help Tan with this question. Can you?

    And bear in mind whatever I said: Foresighting is a process. It is not prediction. In the past, before I gave all this background, I asked students to do this activity. And trust me, many groups will come up with the answer saying, "In 2032, there are going to be more AIs, there are going to be hologram professors, blah blah blah, AI bots, chatbots as teaching assistants, etc." Trust me, that's not called foresighting. If you were to take that to Prof Tan, he is going to throw it back at you.

    So, you need to understand foresighting is a process. And I also told you, foresighting is about painting future scenarios for which you need to collect data. What kind of data you will collect? What kind of process you will undertake? That is going to be the focus of your group activity. Is this clear? Don't tell me the final outcome of [the] classroom, that's what I don't want. I want you to walk through how Prof Tan... if he were to answer this question, how he would engage in intelligence activities. That's what I want you to focus on. Is this clear to everybody? Everyone? Let's do it after a short break. Let's come back by 7:35. And then we'll do this quick one and then we'll move on to... Okay.

    那我們做一件事，我們先休息一下，然後進行這個課堂活動。課堂活動……希望那時候你們都已經組好隊了。對於這個模組，我們一組大約五到六名成員。你們不必為了這個小組項目而堅持跟同一組人在一起。當然，小組項目是有的，你們必須有一個小組，但今天你們可以隨意組隊。看看你們是否與組員有協同效應。所以組成一個五到六人的小組，我希望你們在休息後進行這個活動。

    在這個活動中，你們將被 NUS 校長 Tan 教授聘用，他會說……他會給你們提出這個問題：“2032 年的新加坡國立大學應該擁有什麼樣的教室？”作為情報官員/分析師，你們要幫助 Tan 教授解決這個問題。可以嗎？

    請記住我說過的話：前瞻（Foresighting）是一個過程。它不是預測。過去，在我提供所有這些背景知識之前，我讓學生做過這個活動。相信我，許多小組會給出的答案是：“在 2032 年，會有更多的 AI，會有全息影像教授，等等等等，AI 機器人，聊天機器人助教等等。”相信我，那不叫前瞻。如果你們把那個拿給 Tan 教授看，他會把它扔回給你們。

    所以，你們需要明白前瞻是一個過程。而且我也告訴過你們，前瞻是關於描繪未來的場景，為此你們需要收集數據。你們會收集什麼樣的數據？你們將採取什麼樣的過程？這將是你們小組活動的重點。清楚了嗎？不要告訴我教室的最終結果，這不是我想要的。我希望你們展示如果 Tan 教授要回答這個問題，他該如何進行情報活動。這就是我希望你們關注的重點。大家清楚了嗎？所有人？我們在短暫休息後開始。我們 7:35 回來。然後我們會快速做完這個，接著我們會繼續……好的。

  - **01:00:00 - 01:00:46: The Role of the Analyst and Interfacing with Decision Makers**

    **Professor**: ...have tons of things to look at. So your job as analyst is to first go and ask the decision maker: what is your intention basically? If he says this is a problem I want to tackle it at least in two years, three years down the line, then your problem statement is perfectly fine. That's where as, at the bottom as analyst, you should always interface with your decision maker to understand what does he or she wants. Right? If they give a question like that, it is your job to go and ponder about it. If you take the question as given and assume something and do, that's not right. Right? You as consultants need to work with your clients, and in this case, it's Prof Tan. Nothing wrong. Good that you developed it further by looking at what they are doing. You want to share more? Yeah. Is that clear to everyone? That's why I said in... in Week 4 I'll tell you a framework wherein... that's why I said it's... this module is important for R&D analyst, intelligence analyst as well as decision makers because you should see the connection happening. If not, everything will fall apart. Yeah. Go further.

    ...有很多东西需要通过。所以作为分析师，你的工作首先是去询问决策者：你的意图到底是什么？如果他说这是一个我想在至少两三年后解决的问题，那么你的问题陈述就完全没有问题。这就是作为底层的分析师，你应该始终与决策者沟通，了解他或她想要什么的地方。对吧？如果他们给出那样一个问题，你的工作就是去仔细思考它。如果你直接接受问题并基于假设去执行，那是不对的。对吧？作为顾问，你需要与你的客户合作，在这种情况下就是陈教授（Prof Tan）。这没错。很好，你通过观察他们正在做的事情进一步拓展了它。你想分享更多吗？好的。大家都清楚了吗？这就是为什么我说在...在第四周我会告诉你们一个框架，其中...这就是为什么我说...这个模块对研发分析师、情报分析师以及决策者都很重要，因为你们应该看到其中的联系。否则，一切都会分崩离析。好的。继续。

  - **01:00:46 - 01:01:17: Discussing Future Scenarios (Student Response)**

    **Student**: This involves the different possible scenarios that could happen in five to seven years. One could be the focus is more on tech jobs. One was more on entrepreneurship... like NUS [inaudible at 00:58] just running his specific startup. So then with all of these [inaudible at 01:03] scenarios as well. And then we talked about a... [Student 2 speaks] ...population. I mean, they want benefit for the possible future.

    **Professor**: Yeah. You should also talk about futures to this. Currently in schools and education policies

    **学生**: 这涉及未来五到七年可能发生的不同情景。一种可能是重点更多地放在科技工作上。另一种更多是关于创业精神... 就像新加坡国立大学（NUS）[00:58 处听不清] 只是经营他特定的初创公司。所以，结合所有这些 [01:03 处听不清] 情景。然后我们要谈论一个... [学生2发言] ...人口。我的意思是，他们希望为可能的未来获益。

    **教授**: 是的。你也应该谈谈这方面的未来。目前在学校和教育政策中

  - **01:10:00 - 01:10:27: Wrapping up Student Discussion**

    **Professor**: ...population. I mean, they want benefit for the possible future. This is how I wanted you all to think. Yeah. I jumped the gun too early. Can we move on, in the interest of time?

    ...人口。我的意思是，他们希望为可能的未来获益。这就是我希望你们思考的方式。是的。我太早下结论了。为了节省时间，我们可以继续吗？

  - **01:10:27 - 01:10:54: Technology Foresight Ignores the Present?**

    **Professor**: [Reading Quiz Question] Technology foresight ignores present and looks only at future. If you have been listening, you will know the answer. You cannot ignore the present. You should know where you are. Foresighting is all about... you should know where you are now, what are the potential futures that can pan out, and try to find a way that you can be there five years, ten years down the line. You need to navigate the way today.

    [阅读测验问题] 技术预见忽略现在，只看未来。如果你一直在听，你会知道答案。你不能忽略现在。你应该知道你在哪里。预见就是关于... 你应该知道你现在在哪里，未来有哪些可能的情景，并试图找到一条路，让你在五年、十年后到达那里。你需要从今天开始导航。

  - **01:10:54 - 01:11:21: Is Foresight a One-time Activity?**

    **Professor**: Technology foresight is... this is a very important question. It's a one-time activity, ongoing process, or both?

    技术预见是... 这是一个非常重要的问题。它是一次性活动，持续的过程，还是两者兼而有之？

  - **01:20:00 - 01:22:45: Applying Foresight to Strategy**

    **Professor**: ...identify new opportunities. So I can enhance it, or I can extend it. Say, for example, I'm doing research only on technology management. Maybe I should extend it to knowledge management. Or maybe I should extend it to open innovation. Or maybe I should extend it to sustainability. So that's extension of my power zone. Or completely new opportunities. I stop being a professor, I go become an entrepreneur. I take my research and translate it into a startup. That's a completely new opportunity for me. And that decision I make based on the foresight exercise. That's what the article says.

    Is this clear to everybody? The three outcomes? And the three outcomes are very important. Why? Why do you think identifying these three outcomes are important? Why can't I just say, okay, I'll do whatever I want?

    **Student**: [Inaudible answer about resources/direction]

    **Professor**: Exactly. To allocate resources. If I want to start a company, I need different kinds of resources. If I want to extend my research to sustainability, I need to hire people who are experts in sustainability, or I need to collaborate with people in sustainability. So the resource allocation depends on these three outcomes. And that's why you need to be very clear on what you want to achieve.

    Is this clear? Any questions so far?

    **Student**: [Inaudible question]

    **Professor**: Yeah.

    **Student**: [Inaudible question about power zone]

    **Professor**: Correct.

    **Student**: [Inaudible question about dynamic capabilities]

    **Professor**: Very good question. Power zone is your current capability. Dynamic capability is how you evolve your capability over time. So power zone is a static snapshot of what you are good at today. Dynamic capability is the process of changing that power zone. Very good question. We will cover dynamic capabilities later in the module. It's a very important concept in strategic management. But for now, just think of power zone as your current strength. What are you good at today? What pays your bills today? That's your power zone. Okay?

    **教授**: ...识别新机会。所以我可以增强它，或者我可以扩展它。比如说，我只做技术管理的研究。也许我应该把它扩展到知识管理。或者也许我应该把它扩展到开放式创新。或者也许我应该把它扩展到可持续性。那是对我权力区域的扩展。或者是全新的机会。我不再当教授，我去当企业家。我把我的研究转化为一家初创公司。对我来说那是全新的机会。而那个决定是我基于预见练习做出的。这就是文章所说的。

    大家都清楚了吗？这三个结果？这三个结果非常重要。为什么？你们认为为什么识别这三个结果很重要？为什么我不能只说，好吧，我想做什么就做什么？

    **学生**: [关于资源/方向的回答听不清]

    **教授**: 正是。为了分配资源。如果我想开一家公司，我需要不同种类的资源。如果我想把我的研究扩展到可持续性，我需要雇佣可持续性方面的专家，或者我需要与可持续性领域的人合作。所以资源分配取决于这三个结果。这就是为什么你需要非常清楚你想要实现什么。

    清楚了吗？到目前为止有什么问题吗？

    **学生**: [问题听不清]

    **教授**: 是的。

    **学生**: [关于权力区域的问题听不清]

    **教授**: 正确。

    **学生**: [关于动态能力的问题听不清]

    **教授**: 很好的问题。权力区域是你目前的能力。动态能力是你如何随着时间演变你的能力。所以权力区域是你今天擅长什么的静态快照。动态能力是改变那个权力区域的过程。很好的问题。我们稍后会在模块中涵盖动态能力。它是战略管理中一个非常重要的概念。但现在，只把权力区域想成是你目前的优势。你今天擅长什么？今天什么为你支付账单？那就是你的权力区域。好吗？

  - **01:22:45 - 01:25:06: Intelligence vs. Foresight**

    **Professor**: Okay. So let's move on. We talked about foresight. Now let's talk about intelligence. What is intelligence? How is it different from foresight? Or are they the same?

    **Student**: [Inaudible answer]

    **Professor**: Okay. Intelligence is about information. Foresight is about future scenarios. Okay. Anybody else?

    **Student**: [Inaudible answer about actionable insights]

    **Professor**: Actionable insights. Very good. Intelligence leads to actionable insights. Foresight leads to future scenarios. But aren't future scenarios actionable? If I say in 2032 classrooms will be like this, isn't that actionable? I can start building that classroom today.

    **Student**: [Inaudible answer]

    **Professor**: Okay. So let's look at the definition. Intelligence warns an organization of technological threats and identifies potential technological opportunities. It's about managing technologies, present and emerging, from both inside and outside the company. It's like a radar. You're constantly scanning. Scanning for what? Threats and opportunities.

    And it transforms gathered information into intelligence. So information is just raw data. Intelligence is processed data that is useful for decision making. That's the key difference. Information is everywhere. Google gives you information. But Google doesn't give you intelligence. You have to process that information, put it in context, analyze it, and then it becomes intelligence.

    Is this clear? The difference between data, information, and intelligence?

    Data is raw numbers. Information is data with context. Intelligence is information with analysis and implications.

    So, for example, if I say the temperature is 30 degrees. That's data. If I say the temperature is 30 degrees, it's hot today. That's information. If I say the temperature is 30 degrees, it's hot today, so people will buy more ice cream, so I should stock up on ice cream. That's intelligence.

    You see the difference? It leads to action. Decision making.

    And foresight... foresight is about looking further ahead. Intelligence is usually about the here and now, or the near future. Foresight is about the long term. Five years, ten years, twenty years. And it involves more uncertainty. Intelligence tries to reduce uncertainty. Foresight embraces uncertainty. It says, okay, there are multiple futures. I don't know which one will happen, but I can prepare for all of them. Or I can try to shape the future I want.

    So they are related, but they are distinct. Intelligence feeds into foresight. You need good intelligence to do good foresight. But foresight goes beyond intelligence. It adds imagination, creativity, scenario planning.

    Okay? So that's the key distinction.

    **教授**: 好的。那我们继续。我们谈论了预见。现在我们来谈谈情报。什么是情报？它与预见有何不同？还是说它们是一样的？

    **学生**: [回答听不清]

    **教授**: 好的。情报是关于信息。预见是关于未来情景。好的。还有其他人吗？

    **学生**: [关于可操作见解的回答听不清]

    **教授**: 可操作的见解。非常好。情报导致可操作的见解。预见导致未来情景。但是未来情景不是可操作的吗？如果我说 2032 年教室会是这样，那不是可操作的吗？我今天就可以开始建造那个教室。

    **学生**: [回答听不清]

    **教授**: 好的。那我们来看看定义。情报警告组织技术威胁并识别潜在的技术机会。它是关于管理技术，现在的和新兴的，来自公司内部和外部。它就像雷达。你在不断扫描。扫描什么？威胁和机会。

    并且它将收集到的信息转化为情报。所以信息只是原始数据。情报是经过处理的、对决策有用的数据。那是关键区别。信息无处不在。谷歌给你信息。但谷歌不给你情报。你必须处理那些信息，把它放在背景中，分析它，然后它才变成情报。

    清楚了吗？数据、信息和情报之间的区别？

    数据是原始数字。信息是带有背景的数据。情报是带有分析和含义的信息。

    所以，例如，如果我说气温是 30 度。那是数据。如果我说气温是 30 度，今天很热。那是信息。如果我说气温是 30 度，今天很热，所以人们会买更多冰淇淋，所以我应该储备冰淇淋。那是情报。

    你看到区别了吗？它导致行动。决策。

    而预见... 预见是关于看得更远。情报通常是关于此时此地，或不久的将来。预见是关于长期。五年，十年，二十年。并且它涉及更多不确定性。情报试图减少不确定性。预见拥抱不确定性。它说，好的，有多种未来。我不知道哪一种会发生，但我可以为所有这些做准备。或者我可以试图塑造我想要的未来。

    所以它们是相关的，但它们是不同的。情报输入到预见中。你需要好的情报来做好的预见。但预见超越了情报。它增加了想象力、创造力、情景规划。

    好吗？所以那是关键区别。

  - **01:20:00 - 01:21:21: Closing Remarks and Next Steps**

    **Professor**: ...with that I'll stop my lecture today. I know it's been a long day for you all. But I hope you found this session useful. At least getting an introduction to what this module is about, what foresighting is, what intelligence is.

    So next week, we will have a guest lecture. Mr. Koo Seng Meng from AI Singapore. He will talk about "Technology Intelligence: Why & Practice". He will share his experience from AI Singapore, how they do intelligence, why it is important for them. It will be a very interesting session. I encourage you all to come prepared with questions.

    And also, please form your groups for the class activity. You can start discussing the "NUS in 2032" topic. We will do the activity next week after the guest lecture. So come prepared with some initial thoughts.

    And also, please go through the reading materials for next week. It will help you understand the guest lecture better.

    Okay? Any final questions?

    **Student**: [Inaudible question about group size]

    **Professor**: Five to six members. Yeah. Five to six members per group.

    **Student**: [Inaudible question]

    **Professor**: Yes, you can. You can have members from different backgrounds. That's actually better. Diverse perspectives.

    Okay. If no more questions, thank you all. Have a good evening. See you next week.

    **教授**: ...今天的讲座就到这里。我知道这对大家来说是漫长的一天。但我希望你们觉得这节课有用。至少对这个模块是关于什么的，什么是预见，什么是情报有了一个初步了解。

    下周，我们将有一场客座讲座。来自新加坡人工智能（AI Singapore）的 Koo Seng Meng 先生。他将谈论“技术情报：原因与实践”。他将分享他在新加坡人工智能的经验，他们如何做情报，为什么这对他们很重要。这将是一个非常有趣的会议。我鼓励大家准备好问题。

    另外，请为课堂活动组建你们的小组。你们可以开始讨论“2032 年的新加坡国立大学”这个话题。我们将在下周客座讲座后进行这个活动。所以请带着一些初步的想法来。

    还有，请阅读下周的阅读材料。这将帮助你们更好地理解客座讲座。

    好吗？还有最后的问题吗？

    **学生**: [关于小组规模的问题听不清]

    **教授**: 五到六名成员。是的。每组五到六名成员。

    **学生**: [问题听不清]

    **教授**: 是的，你可以。你可以有来自不同背景的成员。那实际上更好。多样化的视角。

    好的。如果没有更多问题，谢谢大家。祝大家晚上愉快。下周见。
## Week 2
  [18:05–18:07] **Class setup, participation rules, and agenda**
  **English** Today we’ll do it a bit differently so there’s more synergy within each group. It will be a group challenge rather than purely individual work. If your group genuinely feels there are free-riders, let me know. Likewise, if someone clearly explored the topic much more deeply and became a key contributor, tell me as well—so they can receive extra points.
  For today’s agenda: we’ll start with a quick summary of last week, then we’ll have our guest segment, and finally we’ll discuss technology intelligence and foresighting—especially *why it is important*. That “why” is what the benchmarking report is mainly about.

  **Chinese** 今天我们换一种方式，让小组内部更有“协同感”。会更像小组挑战，而不只是个人输出。
  如果你们小组确实觉得有人在“搭便车”，可以私下告诉我；反过来，如果有人明显做得更深入、贡献更关键，也请告诉我，我会给额外加分。
  今天流程是：先快速回顾上周内容 → 然后是嘉宾分享 → 最后讨论技术情报（TI）与远见/前瞻（foresighting），重点是：**为什么它重要**。这也是今天 benchmarking report 的核心。

  [18:06–18:07] **Last week recap prompt + forum posting guidance**
  **English** Any questions from last week—what foresighting is, and Carlson’s article? I noticed there were quite a few non-ChatGPT discussion posts on the forum, which is good. But there was also a strange random post under the “ChatGPT” area and I couldn’t identify who posted it.
  Also, the number of posts has gone down (that’s fine). I’m not opening new posts for this week; the forum activity will continue until next week. Please contribute more, but focus on quality.
  One more point: I didn’t set up the Canvas page for people to post figures. If you have a block diagram or mind map, can you post it on Canvas? Then I’ll go back to checking the forum for both ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT discussions. If you have any difficulties with the module, raise them early—don’t wait until the end of the semester.

  **Chinese** 上周内容有没有问题？比如：什么是 foresighting，以及 Carlson 那篇文章？
  我看到论坛里有不少“非 ChatGPT”的讨论贴，挺好。但也出现了一个很奇怪的“ChatGPT 区”的随机贴，我找不到是谁发的。
  另外，这周帖子数量下降也没关系。我这周不会再开新的讨论区，论坛讨论会延续到下周。请继续发，但更强调**质量**。
  还有：我之前没在 Canvas 上专门开“图表/框图/思维导图”的提交位置。如果你做了框图或 mind map，可以发在 Canvas 上。之后我会同时看论坛里 ChatGPT 和非 ChatGPT 的内容。
  课程有任何困难请尽早说，别拖到学期末才反馈。

  [18:07–18:09] **Quick conceptual check: foresighting vs crisis management**
  **English** Let’s answer a few quick questions. First: is foresighting the same as crisis management?
  No. Crisis management is about solving immediate, pressing problems. It’s reactive. Foresighting is long-term and proactive: you’re dealing with future-oriented problems, mitigating threats *and* identifying opportunities. Crisis management is usually about mitigating threats in the short term, not about opening up future opportunities.

  **Chinese** 我们先用几个问题做“概念校准”。第一个：foresighting 是不是等同于 crisis management（危机管理）？
  不是。危机管理解决的是**眼前的紧急问题**，偏被动、反应式；foresighting 面向**更长期**，偏主动：既要降低未来威胁，也要抓住未来机会。危机管理通常只关注短期“止损”，而不是系统性布局机会。

  [18:09–18:11] **Is TI/foresight purely “technology”? + broader lenses including ethics**
  **English** Next: is technology intelligence and foresighting purely a “technology-only” exercise? If you Google “technology intelligence,” you’ll also see competitor intelligence, social intelligence, etc.
  The answer is: it used to be narrower when time horizons were short and the scope was limited. But when the time horizon becomes longer, you must look beyond technology: market, social factors, environmental factors, and human behavior. (Think back to the classroom-of-the-future exercise—learning behavior matters.)
  And one more lens that many people forget: ethics. Ethics should be part and parcel of technology assessment—especially in AI. Many of you working on AI will have encountered AI ethics; it matters at the system and societal level, and it needs to be included in how we assess and steer technology.

  **Chinese** 下一个问题：技术情报/前瞻是不是纯粹“只看技术”的事情？
  以前在**时间跨度短、范围窄**时，可能更像只看技术。但只要时间跨度拉长，你必须把视角扩展到：市场、社会、环境、人的行为等。（比如你们做“未来课堂”的活动，本质上就离不开学习行为。）
  另外一个经常被忽略的维度：**伦理**。伦理不应该缺席技术评估，尤其是 AI。做 AI 的同学基本都接触过 AI ethics——它会影响技术能不能被接受、能不能规模化落地，所以应该进入评估框架。

  [18:11–18:14] **Top-down vision vs structured process (Delphi)**
  **English** Another question raised on the forum: is foresighting basically a visionary leader giving directions—top-down speculation?
  A visionary leader can help, and foresight can be triggered top-down or bottom-up. But foresighting is fundamentally a *process* involving people with different skills and perspectives (R&D, business unit managers, etc.).
  If it’s only one leader driving it, it may work only if that person is unusually accurate—which is rare. If the leader leaves, the system can collapse. Worse, if that leader is strongly opinionated but wrong, the company gets locked into the wrong direction. This often happens in SMEs where the leader decides because they lack bandwidth.
  That does not mean “ignore visionaries.” In fact, foresight has methods like the **Delphi method**: systematically collecting opinions from *multiple* experts/leaders, iterating toward areas of consensus, and combining qualitative and quantitative evidence—rather than letting a single person dictate the future.

  **Chinese** 论坛里还有一个常见误解：foresighting 是不是“有个远见型领导拍板”，纯自上而下的推演？
  领导的远见当然重要，foresight 也可以自上而下启动，或者自下而上从一线发现信号。但本质上它是一个**流程**：要把不同角色（研发、业务单元、市场等）的视角整合起来。
  如果完全靠一个人带方向，只有在这个人极其“天才且持续正确”时才可能成功，但这很少见；领导离开后体系可能断掉；更糟的是领导如果强势但判断错，公司会被锁死在错误方向。中小企业确实常这样运行，因为资源不足。
  但这不等于不要专家/远见者。相反，foresight 里有 **Delphi 方法**：让多个专家/行业领导分轮次给判断、不断收敛共识，并结合定量与定性证据，而不是“一言堂”。

  [18:14–18:15] **Where ethics fits in foresight**
  **English** How does ethics come in? One way is as a guiding principle: it supports transparency and legitimacy, and clarifies what values the organization wants to advance.
  At what stage should ethics appear—early, mid, late? Ideally, it should be introduced early enough to define “what we are moving toward” and what is out of bounds. Detailed assessment can be refined later, but shared ethical direction prevents teams from optimizing toward a future that becomes unacceptable or non-adoptable.

  **Chinese** 伦理在 foresight 里怎么“落位”？一种很实用的理解是：伦理是一套**指导原则**，帮助透明化、建立合法性/可信度，并明确组织想坚持的价值。
  伦理应该在早期、中期还是后期出现？比较好的做法是：**早期就要出现**，先明确“我们想走向哪里、什么不能做”。后续可以再做更细的评估与审计，但如果一开始价值边界不清，团队很容易把系统优化到一个“社会不接受/难以落地”的方向。

  [18:15–18:17] **Transition to guest lecture**
  **English** Let’s welcome our guest speaker, Mr. Koo Seng Meng (AI Singapore). He has a busy schedule of travel and work, yet he still made time to join us.

  **Chinese** 接下来欢迎我们的嘉宾：AI Singapore 的 Koo Seng Meng 先生。行程很满，但还是抽时间来给我们分享。

  [18:17–18:20] **Guest background + key framing: real-world foresight is messy**
  **English** (Guest) I started with R&D and patents (e.g., early display technologies—many of you may not have seen cathode ray tubes). I moved from R&D into business development and technology portfolio work. In 2012 I joined Singapore’s public service (then under the Infocomm Development Authority).
  Over time I see myself as an “intrapreneur,” launching several first-in-region or first-in-world products across industry (e.g., Sony Ericsson, Siemens, and public sector roles). Today I’m Director of Talent Development at AI Singapore, working on capacity/capability building and shaping the talent ecosystem with government agencies.
  For today, I want to share AI Singapore’s ~8-year journey. In practice, technology forecasting/foresight is not clean-cut—it is messy. Often we understand things in hindsight more clearly than in real time.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）我最早做研发与专利（例如早期显示技术——现在很多同学可能都没见过阴极射线管 CRT）。后来从研发转到业务拓展与技术组合管理。2012 年进入新加坡公共部门（当时在 IDA 体系内）。
  我把自己看作“企业内创业者（intrapreneur）”，曾推动过一些区域首创/全球首创的产品与项目。现在我在 AI Singapore 做人才发展负责人，主要做能力建设、生态建设，并和政府机构一起塑造人才体系。
  今天我想用 AI Singapore 过去大约 8 年的发展过程来讲：现实世界里的预测/前瞻并不“干净”，往往很“混乱”；很多时候我们是事后回看才更清晰。

  [18:20–18:23] **AISG origin: national foresight cycle and phased national strategy**
  **English** (Guest) AI Singapore started in 2017, but the decision to invest in AI was discussed earlier (around 2015) at the national level under Singapore’s research governance structure. The key issue was: AI is a frontier technology, we “don’t know what we don’t know,” so we must invest strategically.
  AI Singapore was set up as a national program office coordinated across multiple government agencies. Early mandate: explore possibilities and “fail fast” if needed. By 2019 we learned what worked and what didn’t, helping shape Singapore’s National AI Strategy (version 1). In 2023 the strategy was updated to 2.0 as AI matured—from “what is AI?” to “what can we do with AI?”
  In the public sector we often behave like “professional crystal-ball users”: we ingest information (patents, industry conversations, signals), filter, analyze, spin up programs, and learn via feedback loops. That is forecasting/foresight at a national scale.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）AI Singapore 在 2017 年成立，但国家层面对 AI 的战略投资讨论更早（大约 2015 年）。核心难点是：AI 属于前沿技术，我们“不知道自己不知道什么”，所以必须更有策略地投。
  AI Singapore 被设为国家级项目办公室，由多个政府机构共同协调。早期使命很明确：探索可能性，必要时快速试错。到 2019 年积累了经验，推动形成国家 AI 战略 1.0；到 2023 年升级为 2.0——因为 AI 更成熟了，重点从“AI 是什么”转到“AI 能做什么”。
  公共部门很多时候像“职业水晶球”：我们尽可能多地收集信息（专利、产业访谈等），筛选分析，启动项目，再通过反馈回路不断调整——这就是国家尺度的 forecasting/foresight。

  [18:23–18:26] **AISG KPIs and “value chain” view of AI**
  **English** (Guest) Early KPIs were simple: publish 100 top AI papers, do 100 industry projects, and run “AI Grand Challenges” in key ministries/sectors (e.g., health, urban solutions, education). Over time, strategies evolve as the technology evolves.
  A useful way to see AISG is a pipeline from research → technology → governance → product innovation → talent development. Another lens is “value capture”: AI is just technology unless you can extract value—economic growth, research excellence, and talent outcomes. So we consider AI value across research, policy/platform, business, and talent pipeline.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）早期 KPI 很直白：顶级论文数量、产业项目数量、以及在关键领域做国家级挑战（比如医疗、城市、教育）。但随着技术发展，战略也必须调整。
  看 AISG 可以用“价值链/管线”的视角：研究 → 技术 → 治理 → 产品创新 → 人才发展。
  也可以用“价值获取”的视角：AI 如果不能带来价值（经济增长、科研能力、人才结果），就只是技术。所以我们把价值分布在研究、政策/平台、产业价值、人才管线等维度去管理。

  [18:26–18:30] **Innovation intermediary + Triple Helix + TRL and “valley of death”**
  **English** (Guest) In research terms, AI Singapore is a **public innovation intermediary**. A classical model here is the **Triple Helix**: government + academia + industry working together. Why? Industry often prefers technology at higher maturity (lower risk). Frontier know-how sits in universities, which is why tech transfer offices exist. Government underwrites experimentation risk, and an intermediary entity helps connect performers (research) with adopters (industry).
  We can think in **Technology Readiness Levels (TRL 1–9)**: early concepts (TRL 1–3), mature everyday products (TRL 7–9), and the hard middle (TRL 4–6) often called the “valley/chasm of death” where many technologies fail to cross into deployable products.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）用学术概念说，AI Singapore 属于**公共创新中介（public innovation intermediary）**。经典框架是 **三螺旋（Triple Helix）**：政府 + 学术 + 产业协同。原因很现实：企业通常更偏好成熟度高、风险小的技术；前沿知识更多在大学，所以需要技术转移；政府的角色是为试验与探索“兜底”，中介组织负责把“技术生产者/研究者”和“技术采用者/企业”连接起来。
  这里也会用 **TRL（技术成熟度等级 1–9）** 来理解：1–3 是概念与原理验证，7–9 是产品化与规模化，中间 4–6 是最难跨越的“死亡之谷”，大量技术就在这里卡住。

  [18:31–18:36] **AI-specific adoption challenge: model is small part; need MLOps + data engineering**
  **English** (Guest) In early AISG industry projects (around 2017), even with professors and researchers involved, outcomes often weren’t usable by companies. Back then, today’s cloud model ecosystems didn’t exist in the same way; many solutions were hard-coded or heavily fine-tuned. Models that looked good in development could break in production because real data differs and drifts.
  We learned AI adoption has specific challenges. Research and media hype often overstate adoption; real adoption and value realization can be much lower. One core reason: training a model is only a small part of an AI project. Real-world systems require integration into a digital platform, with two major capabilities many teams lack: **data engineering** and **MLOps (ML/LLM operations)**—deployment, monitoring, and managing model drift. Companies that succeed at AI often already run large-scale data/platform backends (cloud-scale operations).
  Key “proof point”: if the model never goes into production, no real-world value is created. That forced AISG to pivot: build internal engineering capability to translate research into deployable systems and feed insights back into policy and ecosystem diffusion.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）AISG 早期做产业项目时（2017 前后），即使有教授和研究者参与，结果也经常“不好用/落不了地”。当时的云生态和今天不一样，很多方案是硬编码或重度微调；一旦进入生产环境，真实数据分布不同、会漂移，模型就容易崩。
  我们发现 AI 的采用有“特有难题”。媒体的热度和真实落地往往不一致，真正能产生价值的比例可能很低。关键原因之一是：**训练模型只是很小一部分**。现实系统需要集成到数字平台，还需要很多团队缺乏的能力：**数据工程** + **MLOps/LLMOps**（部署、监控、漂移管理）。能把 AI 做成规模化能力的公司，往往本身就有大型数据平台/云化运营能力。
  一个非常硬的结论是：模型不上生产，就没有价值。所以 AISG 后来必须“转向”：补齐工程化能力，做研究到落地的翻译引擎，同时把一线经验反哺政策与生态扩散。

  [18:37–18:41] **Programs: readiness index + apprenticeship as capacity building**
  **English** (Guest) We shaped the ecosystem by diagnosing which organizations are ready. We built an **AI Readiness Index** (a short questionnaire) to classify organizations: AI-unaware → AI-aware → AI-ready → AI-competent. That helps target limited funding: some firms should first become aware; some should buy off-the-shelf solutions; some are ready for custom projects; and some are already competent and don’t need grants.
  For capacity building, we run the **AI Apprenticeship Programme**: working professionals join for ~9 months, train on real industry projects, and graduate with real deployment experience. Entry includes technical tests similar to major tech hiring styles—because industry evaluates practical ability, not only degrees.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）我们做生态建设时，一个关键动作是“先诊断组织是否准备好”。所以做了 **AI Readiness Index**（短问卷），把组织分成：AI 不认知 → AI 有认知 → AI 准备好 → AI 能胜任。这样才能把有限资金用在刀刃上：有的企业先去“补认知”，有的适合买现成方案，有的适合做定制项目，有的已经很强就不需要再拿补助。
  能力建设方面，有 **AI Apprenticeship Programme**：在职人士参加约 9 个月，用真实产业项目训练，最后带着“真实部署经验”出去。入选要做技术测试，形式接近大厂面试，因为行业更看重现场解决问题能力，而不只是学历。

  [18:41–18:45] **What makes an industry-ready AI engineer + “do AI” vs “do things with AI”**
  **English** (Guest) A strong industry AI engineer isn’t defined only by a computer science background. Many industry problems are domain-heavy (healthcare, aviation, logistics, creative industries). What matters is the ability to understand what data is needed and what “good problem framing” looks like in that domain.
  The labor market increasingly needs people who can *do things with AI*, not only people who can *invent AI algorithms*. We also standardize project delivery with agile approaches and package institutional knowledge into playbooks and tools so others can replicate it.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）行业里“好用的 AI 工程师”不一定只靠纯计算机背景。大量项目是强领域属性的（医疗、航空、物流、创意等），关键能力是：懂业务问题怎么定义、需要什么数据、数据质量风险在哪里。
  现在市场越来越需要“会用 AI 做事的人”，而不仅是“会发明算法的人”。同时我们用敏捷方式标准化交付，并把机构经验沉淀成手册/工具，让生态可以复制。

  [18:45–18:55] **Talent pipeline + GenAI shock + job exposure framing**
  **English** (Guest) Talent development must be intergenerational: we need to influence education one to two generations ahead. We built training hubs and progressively expanded from working professionals to schools, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education.
  After late 2022, generative AI accelerated automation. The key change is not “AI replaces humans” in a simple sense, but that AI-assisted digital automation scales rapidly, disrupting tasks and job scopes. Some analyses (e.g., industry reports and surveys) estimate a significant share of modern job tasks are automatable. A helpful framing is exposure: tasks can be insulated (low exposure), augmented (complementary), or disrupted (high substitution).
  Counterintuitively, some high-cognition creative work may be augmented rather than eliminated—because productivity increases (e.g., faster generation of concept variants), even if the workflow changes.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）人才发展必须看“代际”：至少要提前影响 1–2 代人的教育体系。我们先做成人/在职培训的资源库，再逐步往学校推进，并和教育部门合作。
  2022 年底之后，生成式 AI 让自动化加速。关键不是简单的“AI 取代人”，而是 **AI 辅助的数字自动化规模化**，从而改变任务结构与岗位内容。很多报告用“岗位任务可自动化比例”来描述冲击。
  比较实用的框架是“暴露度”：有的工作几乎不受影响（insulated），有的会被增强（augmented，互补），有的会被强替代（disrupted）。
  有趣的是，一些高认知的创意工作不一定被消灭，反而可能被增强——因为工具让产能上升（比如更快生成多版本概念方案），但工作方式会改变。

  [18:55–19:01] **Institutionalization: playbooks, regional LLM (Sea Lion), standards, and “human element”**
  **English** (Guest) As a public entity, long-term value is to encapsulate institutional knowledge and diffuse it—so we encode practices into handbooks/playbooks (how to start an AI project, what is or isn’t an AI project).
  We also invest in a regional language model initiative (Sea Lion) to better represent ASEAN contexts and reduce risks of cultural misrepresentation when models become dominant information interfaces.
  On “rewarding good actors,” standards matter. Singapore participates in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 (AI standards). Standards form a knowledge map and can support compliance and trust-building across jurisdictions.
  Finally, across all programs, the human element remains central: even if technology has clear advantages, individuals may resist adoption. Change management and mindset shifts are often decisive.

  **Chinese** （嘉宾）作为公共机构，长期价值在于把经验“制度化”并扩散出去，所以我们把方法写进手册/工具包（如何启动 AI 项目、什么算 AI 项目、什么不算）。
  我们也投入区域语言模型（Sea Lion），让模型更能覆盖 ASEAN 语境，降低“文化被错误代表”的风险——因为大模型越来越可能成为信息入口。
  对于“奖励守规矩的好参与者”，标准体系很重要。新加坡参与 ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42（AI 标准委员会），标准本身构成一张知识地图，有助于跨地区的合规与信任。
  最后，无论做多少技术项目，“人”的因素都绕不开：技术再好也可能有人抵触使用，所以变革管理与心态迁移往往是成败关键。

  [19:47–19:50] **From guest lecture back to benchmarking: the “luxury to think about the future” problem**
  **English** Let’s come back to a key tension raised in both the guest talk and the benchmarking report. Many firms say: *we are overwhelmed by current problems; we don’t have the luxury to think about the future*.
  This is the million-dollar question: how do you balance today’s survival with future investment? The report highlights that most businesses naturally focus on immediate operational issues and short-term returns, which crowds out foresighting.

  **Chinese** 回到一个在嘉宾分享和 benchmarking 报告中都反复出现的张力：很多企业会说——我们眼前问题已经够多了，根本没有“余力”去想未来。
  这正是“百万美元问题”：如何在**生存压力**和**未来投入**之间取得平衡？报告指出，大多数企业会被短期问题和短期回报牵着走，结果就是 foresighting 被不断挤压。

  [19:48–19:55] **SMEs, limited capability, and the role of intermediaries/government**
  **English** This challenge is especially real for small and medium enterprises. If you’re fighting for bread and butter today, asking you to plan five years ahead feels unrealistic.
  So what should such firms do? One option is to rely on intermediaries and government bodies. That’s precisely why innovation intermediaries exist. When industry is not ready to place bets on discontinuous technologies, the state often steps in early—setting up programs, grants, and shared infrastructure.
  Singapore is often described as being “creature-like” in sensing future threats early. Agencies step in to help SMEs gear up for transitions (for example, emissions-free futures in maritime industries). Firms with capability should juggle short-term and long-term internally; those without should leverage external support.

  **Chinese** 这个问题对中小企业尤其现实：如果今天都在为现金流和生存发愁，让你去想五年、十年后的未来，确实不现实。
  那怎么办？一种可行路径就是**借助中介组织和政府机构**。这正是创新中介存在的意义：当产业还没准备好为“断裂式技术”下注时，国家先行介入，通过项目、补贴、公共平台降低试错成本。
  新加坡常被形容为“提前感知风险”的国家。政府部门会帮助中小企业为转型做准备（比如航运业的减排转型）。有能力的大企业要内部平衡短期与长期；能力不足的中小企业则要善用外部资源。

  [19:55–19:58] **Link to benchmarking report: why profitability and market value**
  **English** This links directly to the benchmarking report. The report uses two outcome variables—**profitability** and **market capitalization**. Why these two?
  Because firms can fail in two opposite ways:

  * Focus only on current profits and lose the future.
  * Focus only on the future and lose current viability.
    The report classifies firms into four types (e.g., vigilant, vulnerable, neurotic, etc.) to show that balance matters. Over-optimizing either side is risky. Incentives and KPIs must reflect this balance.

  **Chinese** 这正好呼应 benchmarking 报告里的核心设计：为什么用 **盈利能力（profitability）** 和 **市值（market capitalization）** 这两个结果变量？
  因为企业可能在两个方向上失败：

  * 只看当下利润，未来被淘汰；
  * 只押未来，眼前先“饿死”。
    报告用四种企业类型（如 vigilant、vulnerable、neurotic 等）来说明：关键在于**平衡**。激励机制和 KPI 设计必须体现这一点。

  [19:58–20:01] **Adoption reality: POCs, employees, and change management**
  **English** A student shared a practical observation: many AI projects stop at proof-of-concept. At management level, expectations are high; at employee level, adoption is low because it adds workload and disrupts routines.
  This is common. Even in universities or public systems, people stop using tools when systems change too frequently. Without investment in **change management**, adoption will stall. Technology foresight without organizational change capability rarely translates into value.

  **Chinese** 有同学分享了很真实的现象：很多 AI 项目卡在 POC 阶段。管理层期待很高，但员工层面的采用率很低，因为工具增加了负担、打乱了原有流程。
  这种情况非常普遍。系统更新太快，人自然会放弃使用。如果企业不投入**变革管理（change management）**，再好的技术也难以落地。没有组织能力支撑的 foresight，很难真正创造价值。

  [20:03–20:06] **Framing the guest lecture as foresight value**
  **English** Bringing it back: the guest lecture answers the question, *how does a nation prepare for future technological disruption?*
  Key takeaways include: using readiness assessments, talent pipelines from school to workforce, and playbooks built from repeated experimentation (e.g., “100 experiments”). These are concrete ways foresight translates into value—not just abstract thinking.

  **Chinese** 回到主题：嘉宾分享本质上回答了一个问题——**国家如何为未来的技术颠覆做准备？**
  关键启示包括：用 readiness 评估工具、从学校到职场的人才管线、以及通过大量实验沉淀成“可复制的 playbook”（例如 100 次实验）。这些都是 foresight 转化为价值的具体机制，而不只是抽象讨论。

  **00:00 - 02:45: Change Management & Government Support for AI**

  **Professor:** Don't invest in change management and they want things to change, it's not going to happen. They should be aware of it. It's a big topic in itself. I'll see if I can cover a little bit of it in knowledge management. We need to move on. You have any pressing question? Yes.

  **Student:** Because he mentioned about the confidence for the small and medium enterprises... they cannot cross the gap to reach to the AI Singapore to reach to the government body or agencies. But because they have like limited resources and financial perspective, so they don't have enough money. So if government charge for them...

  **Professor:** No, no, that's wrong. They will give subsidy to these companies. Depends on the government as well. That's why you should be aware of all these grants. There is one paper totally focusing on all the grants provided by every country, especially for small and medium enterprises across different countries that we will look at.

  **Student:** But the government cannot help all these kind of companies, so some of them...

  **Professor:** They need to be selective, right? That's just like how Seng Meng said. They will see how AI-ready they are. If they are not AI-ready, they will say, "Go equip yourself." If you are a little bit AI-ready, they will try to help handhold you. If you are too ready, they will say, "Bye-bye." You're self-sufficient.

  **Student:** So if by not being selected by the government, then I have to look for agencies? Like if I don't have that much of the money for this kind of...

  **Professor:** You are going to be cannibalized soon. You need to invest at least a little bit for your own future. If you are willing to put in a bit, government will put its portion. You see?

  **Professor:** All right. On that note, let's move on to the lecture itself. Oh my god. Okay. This is the first question for the benchmarking report.

  **教授：** 如果不投资于变革管理却希望事情发生改变，那是不会发生的。他们应该意识到这一点。这本身就是一个很大的话题。我会看看能否在知识管理部分稍微涵盖一点。我们需要继续了。你们有什么紧迫的问题吗？请讲。

  **学生：** 因为他提到中小型企业的信心问题……他们无法跨越鸿沟去接触 AI Singapore（新加坡人工智能计划），或者接触政府机构或部门。但因为他们的资源和财务状况有限，所以没有足够的资金。如果政府向他们收费……

  **教授：** 不，不，那是错的。政府会给这些公司提供补贴。这也取决于政府。所以你应该了解所有这些拨款。有一篇论文完全专注于各国提供的所有拨款，特别是针对不同国家的中小型企业，我们会看看那个。

  **学生：** 但是政府不能帮助所有这类公司，所以其中一些……

  **教授：** 他们需要有选择性，对吧？就像 Seng Meng 说的那样。他们会看这些公司的 AI 就绪程度（AI readiness）。如果还没准备好，他们会说：“去充实自己吧。”如果你有一点准备，他们会试着以此引导你。如果你已经准备得很充分了，他们会说：“再见。”因为你已经可以自给自足了。

  **学生：** 那么如果不被政府选中，我就得去找代理机构吗？如果我没有那么多钱做这种……

  **教授：** 你很快就会被吞并（cannibalized）。你需要为自己的未来至少投资一点点。如果你愿意投入一点，政府也会投入它的那部分。明白吗？

  **教授：** 好了。既然如此，我们继续讲课。天哪。好的。这是关于基准报告的第一个问题。

  **02:45 - 06:10: Introduction to Foresight Benchmarking Report**

  **Professor:** Regarding Seng Meng's thing on the top, right? How nation prepares for future or technological disruptions. How it equips... that's the whole message from this talk. How companies like you can tap into such resources and can tap into things like AI readiness levels, can tap into all those charts that he showed. Those are key valuable lessons for you. And last but not least, the talent. How country develops the talents starting from school till the workforce. They didn't even leave the school; they are preparing them also that you need to be aware of.

  **Professor:** So it's more on foresighting at the national level that he shared, but there are lots of lessons for firms. Especially the most valuable being the AI Playbook. These agencies having done 100 experiments... he didn't elaborate more because this is one project wherein I was closely working with him. Which means the government decided, "I am going to help 100 companies in Singapore implement AI and show the returns." You see? This is where it ties up to today's topic. How foresighting is of value. What is the value of foresighting?

  **Professor:** So he mentioned in the initial days the foresighting was all about KPIs. How many companies you help? How many apprentices you created and all? That was the first two cycle. In the third cycle, that's when I started working with him on another project, it talks about what did AI Singapore achieve for the nation? What economic returns did they bring in? That's where the "100E" experiments were helpful. How much of revenue they created? How much of new products they developed? How many new markets they tapped into? So those are economic returns.

  **Professor:** So at some point, even at the national level, it's not enough if you just look at the earlier KPIs. You should also look at tangible value. And that's what any CEOs would ask you. If you say, "Can I implement foresighting for the company? Can you allocate some budget?" They might give you initially, but after the first two cycles they will ask you, "How did you create value for me, for my company?" And that's where the Foresight Benchmarking Report neatly fits in. It will be asked by bosses, it will be asked by country, it will be asked by industry as well.

  **教授：** 关于 Seng Meng 之前讲的内容，对吧？国家如何为未来或技术颠覆做准备。它是如何装备……这是那场讲座的核心信息。像你们这样的公司如何利用这些资源，如何利用像 AI 就绪水平这样的东西，利用他展示的所有那些图表。这些对你们来说都是非常宝贵的经验。最后但同样重要的是人才。国家如何从学校到职场培养人才。他们甚至还没离开学校，国家就已经在为他们做准备了，这也是你们需要知道的。

  **教授：** 所以他分享的更多是国家层面的前瞻（foresighting），但对企业来说也有很多教训。尤其是最有价值的 AI Playbook（人工智能行动指南）。这些机构做了100个实验……他没有详细说明，因为这是一个我和他密切合作的项目。这意味着政府决定：“我要帮助新加坡的100家公司实施人工智能并展示回报。”你看？这就是它与今天主题的联系所在。前瞻的价值是什么？前瞻有什么价值？

  **教授：** 他提到在早期，前瞻主要关于 KPI（关键绩效指标）。你帮助了多少家公司？你培养了多少学徒等等？那是前两个周期。在第三个周期，也就是我开始和他合作另一个项目的时候，讨论的是 AI Singapore 为国家取得了什么成就？他们带来了什么经济回报？这就是“100E”实验有用的地方。他们创造了多少收入？开发了多少新产品？进入了多少新市场？这些都是经济回报。

  **教授：** 所以在某种程度上，即使在国家层面，仅仅看早期的 KPI 是不够的。你还应该看有形的价值。这也是任何 CEO 会问你的。如果你说：“我可以为公司实施前瞻吗？你能分配一些预算吗？”他们最初可能会给你，但在前两个周期之后，他们会问你：“你为我、为我的公司创造了什么价值？”这就是《前瞻基准报告》（Foresight Benchmarking Report）恰好切入的地方。老板会问，国家会问，行业也会问。

  **06:10 - 08:30: Discussion on Decision Making and Foresight Maturity**

  **Professor:** Okay. Now coming back to the Foresight Benchmarking Report. The first challenge is... thought of doing group work but we don't have time so let's make it individual. As a decision maker, what are the key lessons you imbibe from the article? Which aspects should you give more importance to when you read this article? There are two levels at which I'll ask questions about benchmarking report. One is as a decision maker. The other one is as an intelligence agent. So the first question is as a decision maker, what are the key lessons you take away from? Who wants to give it a shot? Yes, Sahil.

  **Student (Sahil):** So one of the things that was mentioned in the report was about perceiving, prospecting and probing. I feel like as a decision maker, what I inferred from this is that these are continuous processes. So from... we start from perceiving and then that moves on to prospecting and then that moves on to probing. So what I inferred is that the most important...

  **Professor:** Okay. Yeah, go ahead. I'm listening.

  **Student (Sahil):** Yeah, what I inferred is that it all starts at perceiving. That is data collection and analyzing what is happening, what is going to happen and all of that. And then we move on to prospecting and probing. So I feel in perceiving, for example, having all the research work done or like having investments... like for example in what he mentioned about AI Singapore, having the investment... making the investment in order for us to get the perceiving information. I think that is the key starting point that then leads to the next steps in order for us to get the returns of whatever was mentioned in the later half of the document. So I felt the starting point is there and that is the most important and once we knock that first block and then the rest of the blocks can happen.

  **Professor:** Understood. So it's a three piece. Right? That a decision maker should be aware of. Okay, good. That's one of the pieces. What else?

  **教授：** 好的。现在回到《前瞻基准报告》。第一个挑战是……本来想做小组作业，但我们没有时间，所以就个人完成吧。作为一个决策者，你从文章中吸取了哪些关键教训？在阅读这篇文章时，你应该更重视哪些方面？我会从两个层面问关于基准报告的问题。一个是作为决策者。另一个是作为情报人员（intelligence agent）。那么第一个问题是，作为决策者，你带走了哪些关键教训？谁想试一试？是的，Sahil。

  **学生 (Sahil)：** 报告中提到的一点是关于感知（perceiving）、展望（prospecting）和探索（probing）。我觉得作为决策者，我从中推断出这些是持续的过程。所以从……我们从感知开始，然后进入展望，再进入探索。所以我推断最重要的是……

  **教授：** 好的。请继续，我在听。

  **学生 (Sahil)：** 是的，我推断一切都始于感知。即数据收集和分析正在发生什么、将要发生什么等等。然后我们进入展望和探索。所以我感觉在感知阶段，例如完成所有的研究工作或者进行投资……比如他提到的关于 AI Singapore 的内容，进行投资……为了让我们获得感知信息而进行投资。我认为这是一个关键的起点，然后通过它进入后续步骤，以便我们获得文档后半部分提到的那些回报。所以我感觉起点在那里，那是最重要的，一旦我们要敲开了第一块砖，剩下的部分就会顺理成章地发生。

  **教授：** 明白了。所以它是三个“P”（Three Ps）。对吧？决策者应该意识到的。好的，很好。这是其中一部分。还有什么？

  **08:30 - 10:00: Evaluating Foresight Readiness vs. Performance**

  **Student:** Uh, as a decision maker, I think... I'm aware that there is a measurement that can give me advice what my organization or my company is standing on. Whether the foresighting for my company is enough or not. Which brings... which brings my company is dangerous in the future or is safe. So...

  **Professor:** Foresight maturity... gauging. Okay, good. What else?

  **Student:** So as a decision maker, I believe what my decision is is to whether I should invest money in this or not. So what I should do or what I think is important is to see if the foresight maturity match the foresight needs. And then after that I categorize whether the company is at what stage before I make the decision of whether I should invest money.

  **Professor:** Yeah. So very good. Before I decide on whether I want to invest on foresighting itself, what is the need for my industry? Is it even needed? So that I don't become neurotic. Right? Yeah. What else?

  **Student:** So in order to do that, I think as a decision maker, one would definitely know how the company perform. So this measuring the firm performance would be one important criteria to know. So that then you will come to know whether you need the foresighting. So it's more of the firm performance.

  **Professor:** That cannot be the right gauge. So when you say performance what will you look at?

  **Student:** You look at the company performance, also your competitor, the data and things like that.

  **Professor:** But what if they are doing well today? So can they be satisfied about it? That's where the problem lies. I am good today but am I prepared for future? It's a question mark.

  **Student:** But if we don't know where are we performing today, then how do we...

  **Professor:** It's a hygiene factor. I don't deny it. Of course any boss will do that. Am I performing well or not? But you shouldn't use that as a metric to decide whether is my foresighting enough or not. That's what I mean. Of course we should be aware of performance. We should gauge it. We should know where they are standing with respect to competitors. But that, while that is hygiene factor, that cannot determine whether they should invest in futuristic vision or not. These two can be very different. That's why I said there are two things. When you look at performance, if you are looking at only profitability, that cannot be the right gauge. That's the whole crux of the article. You need to look at future potential of the company. That's where the market capitalization comes in picture. Let's take there and come here.

  **学生：** 呃，作为决策者，我想……我知道有一种衡量标准可以给我建议，告诉我我的组织或公司处于什么位置。我公司的前瞻工作是否足够。这会带来……这表明我的公司在未来是处于危险之中还是安全的。所以……

  **教授：** 前瞻成熟度（Foresight maturity）……评估。好的，很好。还有什么？

  **学生：** 作为一个决策者，我认为我的决定在于是否应该在这方面投资。所以我应该做的，或者我认为重要的是，看看前瞻成熟度是否与前瞻需求相匹配。然后在决定是否应该投资之前，我会对公司处于什么阶段进行分类。

  **教授：** 是的。非常好。在我决定是否要投资于前瞻本身之前，我的行业对此有什么需求？是否真的需要？这样我就不会变得“神经质”（neurotic）。对吧？是的。还有什么？

  **学生：** 为了做到这一点，我认为作为决策者，必须知道公司的表现如何。所以衡量公司绩效是一个重要的标准。这样你就会知道是否需要前瞻。所以更多的是关于公司绩效。

  **教授：** 那不能作为正确的衡量标准。当你提到绩效时，你会看什么？

  **学生：** 你看公司绩效，也看你的竞争对手，数据之类的。

  **教授：** 但如果他们今天做得很好呢？他们能对此感到满足吗？问题就在这里。我今天很好，但我为未来做好准备了吗？这是一个问号。

  **学生：** 但是如果我们不知道今天的表现如何，那我们要怎么……

  **教授：** 这是一个保健因素（hygiene factor）。我不否认。当然任何老板都会这样做。我表现得好不好？但你不应该用它作为一个指标来决定我的前瞻工作是否足够。这就是我的意思。当然我们应该了解绩效。我们应该评估它。我们应该知道相对于竞争对手他们的位置。但是，虽然那是保健因素，那不能决定他们是否应该投资于未来的愿景。这两者可能非常不同。所以我说有两件事。当你看绩效时，如果你只看盈利能力，那不能作为正确的衡量标准。这是文章的核心关键。你需要看公司的未来潜力。这就是市值（market capitalization）发挥作用的地方。我们从那里接着讲。

  Here is the transcript and translation for **Part [2]** of the audio file.

  ### **10:00 - 12:40: The Trap of Past Success & Crisis Management**

  **Professor:** Is that clear? Convincing to you?

  **Student (Male):** Yeah, yeah. I mean...

  **Professor:** Yeah. It's important. It's a hygiene factor. They need to take note of. If they don't even meet today, then they can't do anything. But that alone is not enough. Yes, Nisha.

  **Student (Nisha):** Yes, Nisha. I think one of the points going from his point is that it's quite deceiving for companies because financial statements or financial performance is very backward looking. You only do at the end of the month. And then one of the things the article mentioned was that by the time all these threats like creep up on you, and with not enough foresight, these threats were essentially invisible. And then once it happens to you, I think it goes back to your question in the beginning... crisis management. It becomes crisis management instead of foresighting.

  **Professor:** Yes. This is the most important thing of the article itself. When they look at only today's performance, they always, you know, become myopic. They get caught in the past. And the past can sometimes become a trap. That's one of the important lessons from here. Past is good, it led to what it is today, but while it defines the power zone, it can also sometimes become the trap. That's why the future... in [Carlson's] article, power zone is important, but you also look at the future and see if some of the power zones should be killed.

  **教授：** 清楚吗？这一通过说服力吗？

  **学生（男）：** 是的，是的。我是说……

  **教授：** 是的。这很重要。这是一个保健因素。他们需要注意。如果他们连今天的要求都达不到，那就什么也做不了。但仅靠这一点是不够的。请讲，Nisha。

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 是的，我是 Nisha。我认为从他的观点延伸出来的一点是，这对公司来说非常有欺骗性，因为财务报表或财务绩效是非常向后看的（滞后的）。你只在月底才做。文章提到的一点是，当所有这些威胁悄悄逼近你时，如果没有足够的前瞻性，这些威胁本质上是隐形的。一旦它发生在你身上，我认为这回到了你开头提出的问题……危机管理。它变成了危机管理，而不是前瞻。

  **教授：** 是的。这是这篇文章本身最重要的一点。当他们只关注今天的表现时，他们总是，你知道，变得目光短浅。他们被过去所困。过去有时会成为陷阱。这是这里最重要的教训之一。过去是好的，它造就了今天的局面，但虽然它定义了“力量区”（power zone），有时也会成为陷阱。这就是为什么未来……在 [Carlson] 的文章中，力量区很重要，但你也得看看未来，看看是否有些力量区应该被砍掉。

  **12:40 - 15:15: Killing Projects & The Four Quadrants**

  **Professor:** Right? I do research in one of... one of the important portions of my research which got recognized was about killing projects. Many firms do not kill projects. If you kill projects, that's going to save a lot of thing for your future as well. Right? If some power zones need to be killed, you need to kill. What needs to be enhanced, added, that needs to be done as well. You get what I mean? What you're saying is important, but don't become obsessed with the current. Then it becomes a trap. That's one of the key lessons. Thanks for pointing that. Yeah.

  **Student:** As a decision maker specifically, what jumps out is how do you develop the incentives, like you mentioned, but also the culture for rewarding the type of thinking that facilitates forecasting. Specifically like is there a fear of like cannibalizing existing business models, like you're saying now, or looking at organizational, like very siloed thinking. How do you reward the opposite of that is what I would focus on from that article.

  **Professor:** Okay, so rewarding futuristic thinking, right? And I guess developing that culture... culture and... okay. Because that is one of the... but I'll come to that later. It's going into the details, but it's important for a leader to think about... Sorry. Yeah, I'll take you now.

  **Student:** Yeah, so the article also mentioned focusing competing with existing competitor and neglect to explore future market. So I think...

  **Professor:** Find a point. Yeah.

  **Student:** Another point is very the managers are focusing on existing selves instead of the future opportunity.

  **Professor:** Yeah. That was covered as well. Yeah. So...

  **Student:** Anything else? As a decision maker, I think he need to, he or she need to evaluate how the maturity of the foresight is in five dimensions including information usage, sophistication of method and people networks, organization and also culture.

  **Professor:** This is where it's kind of overlapping between a decision maker and an intelligence agent. Yes, as a decision maker you need to be aware that culture, infrastructure, information, search and scope, all plays a role... only to that extent. Okay? And it's the role of the intelligence analyst to dig deeper. We'll come to that. But it's important. They should be aware. Yes. Yes, God[win]?

  **Student (Godwin):** Yeah, one thing also as a decision maker, I think it's important that we actually have the right operating environment so that such that you actually have in place the correct methodology of collecting the data as well as the right people who can do the analysis work as well as the future planning.

  **Professor:** Having an overarching structure. Okay. Good.

  **Professor:** And there is one more thing that we discussed which a decision maker should be aware of, that there can be four quadrants, right? Neurotic, Vigilant, In danger, Vulnerable. The four quadrants. They should be aware of it. And aware of it with the corresponding performance. How they go up in terms of performance or go down in terms of profitability and market capitalization. Okay?

  **教授：** 对吧？我做的一项研究……我的一项获得认可的重要研究部分是关于“砍掉项目”的。许多公司不砍项目。如果你砍掉项目，那也会为你的未来节省很多资源。对吧？如果某些力量区需要被砍掉，你就得砍。什么需要加强、增加，那也是需要做的。你明白我的意思吗？你所说的是重要的，但不要过度沉迷于现状。那样它就会变成陷阱。这是一个关键教训。谢谢指出这一点。是的。

  **学生：** 特别是作为决策者，跳出来的问题是如何制定激励机制，就像你提到的，还有如何培养奖励那种促进预测思维的文化。特别是是否存在对吞噬现有商业模式的恐惧，就像你现在说的，或者是组织上的非常孤立的思维。如何奖励相反的行为，这是我会从那篇文章中关注的。

  **教授：** 好的，所以奖励未来主义思维，对吧？我想还有培养那种文化……文化和……好的。因为那是其中一个……但我稍后再谈那个。这涉及到了细节，但对于领导者来说，思考这些很重要……抱歉。是的，我现在听你讲。

  **学生：** 是的，所以文章还提到专注于与现有竞争对手竞争，而忽视了探索未来市场。所以我认为……

  **教授：** 这是一个观点。是的。

  **学生：** 另一点是经理们非常专注于现有的自我（现状），而不是未来的机会。

  **教授：** 是的。那也涵盖了。是的。那么……

  **学生：** 还有其他的吗？作为决策者，我认为他需要，他或她需要评估前瞻的成熟度在五个维度上的表现，包括信息使用、方法的复杂性、人员网络、组织以及文化。

  **教授：** 这就是决策者和情报人员之间有点重叠的地方。是的，作为决策者，你需要意识到文化、基础设施、信息、搜索和范围，所有这些都发挥作用……但也仅限于此。好吗？深入挖掘是情报分析师的职责。我们会谈到那个。但这很重要。他们应该意识到。是的。是的，God[win]？

  **学生 (Godwin)：** 是的，作为决策者还有一件事，我认为重要的是我们实际上要有正确的运营环境，这样你实际上已经有了收集数据的正确方法，以及可以做分析工作和未来规划的合适人选。

  **教授：** 拥有一个总体结构。好的。很好。

  **教授：** 还有一件事我们也讨论过，决策者应该意识到的，那就是可能有四个象限，对吧？神经质（Neurotic）、警惕（Vigilant）、处于危险（In danger）、脆弱（Vulnerable）。这四个象限。他们应该意识到这一点。并且要意识到与之对应的绩效。它们在绩效方面如何上升，或者在盈利能力和市值方面如何下降。好吗？

  **15:15 - 18:00: Analyst Perspective: The 7-Year Time Lag**

  **Professor:** As a decision maker, you need to be aware that yes, foresighting is valuable. Because it generates current profit, it ensures bright future. That you need to be aware of. Second, that you need to be aware of in foresighting doesn't mean you become so engrossed in it. You need to understand that you should do foresighting only to the extent that your industry, your company, wherever you are in your situation, demands. Don't overdo it. It's an overkill. Okay? And don't underdo it as well. That they need to be aware of.

  **Professor:** And to do it, what are the steps you need to take? The 3 Ps. Right? What are the 3 Ps?

  **Class:** Perceiving, Prospecting, Probing.

  **Professor:** Perceiving, Prospecting and Probing. Now I don't want to go into that details, that much details like what you said, because that will be the job of the analyst. They need to be aware of these three things at the higher level. What is perceiving?

  **Professor:** And telling all this because at some point if you were to do foresighting or intelligence, you should pitch your slide to the respective audience. For decision makers these are the things you need to focus on. And same thing for your outputs as well. I told you last week that when you give your deliverables, make it focused to the audience. So you should know for decision makers you need to pitch at this level. Right? Don't give too many details that they don't like. Okay, these are the things.

  **Professor:** For perceiving we have what is called Technology Radar. For prospect we have what is called Scenario Planning. And for probing we have CVCs and listening posts and everything. Right?

  **Professor:** Now the question boils down to: as an analyst, what all aspects in the paper that you should care about? Now as an analyst, you need to care about... Do you have to think about the higher level or you get into the details? The devil is in the details for you as an analyst. So what all details will you do you gather from the article? Yes, [Li Jia]?

  **Student (Li Jia):** Time lag between the foresight activity and the performance outcome.

  **Professor:** Spot on. That's the most important thing. Why... and that's also the first question in my template. What is the purpose of the article? It is to show the value of foresighting. So, do you think you invest in foresighting today and can you look for returns tomorrow? That's bullshit. You can't do. Right? Even for AI Singapore, they gave like three cycles to show their value. So when you invest in foresighting, if you ask for budget from your boss, in two years he is asking for value, you should know what kind of value to show.

  **教授：** 作为决策者，你需要意识到，是的，前瞻是有价值的。因为它产生当前利润，它确保光明的未来。这你需要意识到。第二，你在前瞻中需要意识到，并不意味着你要完全沉迷其中。你需要明白，你应该只做到你的行业、你的公司、你所处的情况所要求的程度。不要做过头。那是画蛇添足（overkill）。好吗？也不要做得不够。这也是他们需要意识到的。

  **教授：** 要做到这一点，你需要采取哪些步骤？三个“P”。对吧？哪三个“P”？

  **全班：** 感知（Perceiving）、展望（Prospecting）、探索（Probing）。

  **教授：** 感知、展望和探索。现在我不想进入那么详细的细节，像你刚才说的那样详细，因为那将是分析师的工作。他们需要在更高层面上意识到这三件事。什么是感知？

  **教授：** 讲这些是因为在某个时候，如果你要做前瞻或情报工作，你应该向相应的受众推销你的幻灯片。对于决策者来说，这些是你需要关注的事情。对于你的产出也是一样。我上周告诉过你们，当你提交交付成果时，要针对受众。所以你应该知道对于决策者，你需要在这个层面上进行推销。对吧？不要给出太多他们不喜欢的细节。好的，就是这些。

  **教授：** 对于感知，我们有所谓的“技术雷达”（Technology Radar）。对于展望，我们有“情景规划”（Scenario Planning）。对于探索，我们有企业风险投资（CVCs）和监听站（listening posts）等等。对吧？

  **教授：** 现在问题归结为：作为一名分析师，你应该关心论文中的哪些方面？现在作为一名分析师，你需要关心……你是要考虑更高层面还是进入细节？对于作为分析师的你来说，魔鬼就在细节中。那么你会从文章中收集哪些细节呢？是的，[Li Jia]？

  **学生 (Li Jia)：** 前瞻活动和绩效结果之间的时间滞后（Time lag）。

  **教授：** 完全正确。那是最重要的事情。为什么……这也是我模板中的第一个问题。文章的目的是什么？是为了展示前瞻的价值。所以，你认为你今天投资前瞻，明天就能看到回报吗？那是胡扯。你做不到。对吧？即使对于 AI Singapore，他们也给了大概三个周期来展示他们的价值。所以当你投资前瞻时，如果你向老板申请预算，两年后他问你要价值，你应该知道要展示什么样的价值。

  **20:00 - 22:30: The Value of Foresight & Managing Expectations**

  **Professor:** If it is 4 years, 6 years down the line, 8 years down the line, if you're still not showing economic value, you are doomed. You'll be out of job. Right?

  **Professor:** So you you should know the time frame. That's why I said when it comes to foresighting the time makes a big difference. As an intelligence analyst you should know how long should I look for... how long should I collect the data.

  **Professor:** Okay? So it took what? 7, 6, 7 years?

  **Class:** Yeah.

  **Professor:** Yeah. From the time till he showed the value. This was the problem. René is who wrote this benchmarking report, he will give you a guest lecture one of the weeks. Okay? He's from France. His group did the study because until then people thought foresighting has no tangible value. Until he spent seven years to do this benchmarking report to show indeed it is valuable to firms. Okay? This is what you need to do. Yeah? Good? Seven years it takes? Yes.

  **Student:** The data accuracy, data confidence or sampling... I need to take off...

  **Professor:** Good. Sampling that you need to think of. Sometimes you go with convenience sampling also. René was at some point, he wanted to do foresighting maturity for the whole world. He asked me to do for Singapore but I didn't have the bandwidth to do for Singapore. You see? So sometimes convenience sampling also works but it needs to be representative. The sample makes a difference. Yes. What else?

  **Student (Nisha):** Isolating like the different business factors from impact of foresight.

  **Professor:** That's the second most important thing in the article. When I presented my... my project which I'll talk about tomorrow, I was presenting to all the executives of A*STAR and EDB is the one which funded it. It was under NRF. So the first thing they asked is: So how can you ensure that the value is not confounded by many factors? It is the foresighting which is creating the value. How can you ensure that? Sometimes people say it could be luck. Right? COVID hit and these industries pumped up. These industries doomed. It's mere luck.

  **Professor:** No, if you were looking for weak signals, you could be ready even for COVID. Right? That's what many companies which managed to be agile to pick up, they survived as well. Right? So the second most important thing in the project, in the paper is that how do you separate the cause and effect from noise? And how did they do it?

  **教授：** 如果那是四年、六年、八年之后，如果你还没有展示出经济价值，你就完了。你会失业的。对吧？

  **教授：** 所以你，你应该知道时间框架。这就是为什么我说，当涉及到前瞻时，时间会有很大不同。作为一名情报分析师，你应该知道我应该观察多长时间……我应该收集多长时间的数据。

  **教授：** 好的？所以这花了多久？7、6、7年？

  **全班：** 是的。

  **教授：** 是的。从那个时候直到他展示价值。这就是问题所在。写这份基准报告的是 René，他将在其中几周给你们做一个客座讲座。好吗？他来自法国。他的小组做了这项研究，因为在那之前人们认为前瞻没有有形价值。直到他花了七年时间做这份基准报告，证明了它对公司确实有价值。好吗？这就是你们需要做的。是吗？好的？花了七年？是的。

  **学生：** 数据准确性、数据置信度或抽样……我需要去掉……

  **教授：** 很好。抽样是你需要考虑的。有时你也会使用便利抽样（convenience sampling）。René 曾经一度想做全世界的前瞻成熟度调查。他让我做新加坡的，但我没有精力做新加坡的。你看？所以有时便利抽样也是可行的，但它需要具有代表性。样本会有所不同。是的。还有什么？

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 将不同的商业因素与前瞻的影响隔离开来。

  **教授：** 那是文章中第二重要的事情。当我展示我的……我的项目（我明天会讲到）时，我是向 A*STAR（新加坡科技研究局）的所有高管展示，EDB（新加坡经济发展局）是资助方。它属于 NRF（新加坡国立研究基金会）。所以他们问的第一件事是：既然如此，你如何确保价值不被许多因素混淆？创造价值的是前瞻。你如何确保这一点？有时人们说这可能是运气。对吧？新冠疫情爆发，这些行业暴涨。那些行业完蛋。这纯粹是运气。

  **教授：** 不，如果你在寻找微弱信号，你甚至可以为新冠疫情做好准备。对吧？这就是许多设法变得敏捷并捕捉到信号的公司幸存下来的原因。对吧？所以项目中，或者说论文中第二重要的事情是，你如何从噪音中分离出因果关系？他们是怎么做到的？

  **22:30 - 25:00: Avoiding Confounding Factors & Industry Clustering**

  **Professor:** How did they manage to do? As an analyst if you can't do it, you're failed already. At least in this paper that's the simplest that they can do which they did. [Chang Wom] does even more sophisticated cause and effect models, I know. Anyone? How did they manage to do? As an analyst if you can't do it, you're failed already.

  **Student:** Anyone?

  **Student:** Their future preparedness concepts to use the maturity consistently and the...

  **Professor:** Exactly. Because different industries needs different foresighting requirements and the maturity can be different. So they came up with this clustering: What is the maturity level of companies? What is the need required? Whether they are in par or whether they are neurotic or they are in danger or, you know, all those vulnerable situations. And then they assess the performance. Maturity compared to the performance. And then they said, "Yeah, future ready firms are indeed performing better."

  **Professor:** If you were to categorize and clu... Did everyone get the point? The clustering like this helped in they avoiding confounding factors from affecting the result. That's the simplest that they did. Is that clear? Or no?

  **Class:** No.

  **Student:** How to...

  **Professor:** Usually they'll do the experiment like control one...

  **Professor:** Control and experimental sample is what they would do. That's what I did in my research next week which I'll show. But in this case, because they were collecting data in the past, you know, they were looking at future ready and then future, what they did is even if you were to do, right, control and experimental, what if it's confounded by different firms from different industries? Which happened in my case.

  **Professor:** So what they did is they looked at companies from different industries. Okay? They grouped them. And then they look at for this industry, what is the foresighting need? Okay? For... it will be different for different industries. And for each firms in each of those industries, they classify the firms maturity, foresighting maturity level. And then they classify the firms into four different types. So that will be done across different industries. Okay?

  **Professor:** So now they look at performance. Whether they perform... the those in foresight ready are doing well or not. And then they do an average across different industries. It is not fool proof but that's the first step towards avoiding confounding factors. You get what I mean?

  **教授：** 他们是如何做到的？作为一名分析师，如果你做不到这一点，你就已经失败了。至少在这篇论文中，这是他们能做的最简单的方法，他们也做到了。[Chang Wom] 做了更复杂的因果模型，我知道。有人知道吗？他们是怎么做到的？作为一名分析师，如果你做不到这一点，你就已经失败了。

  **学生：** 有人吗？

  **学生：** 他们的未来准备度（future preparedness）概念，即一致地使用成熟度和……

  **教授：** 确实如此。因为不同的行业需要不同的前瞻要求，成熟度也会不同。所以他们提出了这种聚类（clustering）：公司的成熟度水平是多少？所需的需求是什么？它们是持平的，还是神经质的，或者是处于危险之中，或者你知道，所有那些脆弱的情况。然后他们评估绩效。将成熟度与绩效进行比较。然后他们说：“是的，为未来做好准备的公司确实表现得更好。”

  **教授：** 如果你要分类和聚……大家都明白了吗？像这样的聚类有助于避免混淆因素影响结果。那是他们做的最简单的事情。清楚了吗？还是不清楚？

  **全班：** 不清楚。

  **学生：** 怎么……

  **教授：** 通常他们会做像控制组那样的实验……

  **教授：** 控制样本和实验样本是他们通常会做的。这正是我下周要在我的研究中展示的。但在这个案例中，因为他们是在收集过去的数据，你知道，他们在看为未来做好的准备以及之后的未来，他们做的是，即使你要做控制组和实验组，如果结果被来自不同行业的不同公司混淆了怎么办？这在我的案例中发生过。

  **教授：** 所以他们做的是，他们观察了来自不同行业的公司。好吗？他们将它们分组。然后他们看对于这个行业，前瞻需求是什么？好吗？对于……不同行业会有所不同。对于这些行业中的每一家公司，他们对公司的成熟度、前瞻成熟度水平进行分类。然后他们将公司分为四种不同类型。所以这将在不同行业之间进行。好吗？

  **教授：** 那么现在他们看绩效。他们是否表现……那些做好前瞻准备的是否表现良好。然后他们在不同行业之间取平均值。这不是万无一失的（fool proof），但这确实是避免混淆因素的第一步。你明白我的意思吗？

  **22:30 - 27:00: Deep Dive into Analyst Metrics**

  **Professor:** Okay. What else as an analyst?

  **Student (Nisha):** What kinds of index should I put into the measurement? And what is the data source? Because the normal financial index... the statement, financial statement balance sheet will not work. So what kind of data should... are we looking for?

  **Professor:** Yeah. So does anyone have an answer? I don't want to show this but there is one thing in the thing about the maturity. You know how maturity was assessed. Right?

  **Class:** Information, methods...

  **Professor:** Information, methods, people and networks, organization and culture. Five aspects, right? And each one of those have different items as well. Whether you like it or not, as an analyst, you might want to give importance to such things. Because that's what you learned from AI SG as well. Maturity level, what are the different indexes you need to do. If your company... for example if you're consulting for [Nisha], her case is very interesting. Had she known about AI readiness index and had she done that for a client, her company need not lose face. Right?

  **Student (Nisha):** Yeah.

  **Professor:** And had she known that index, had she done that for the client. Right? The awareness is very important. There is this index which you can do. Likewise here to assess the foresight maturity there are five different indexes. What about the foresighting need?

  **Professor:** This is a star-star question [Chang Wom]. Foresighting need. Yes.

  **Student:** The [M.L.C.F] and [M.L.C.F]?

  **Professor:** Yeah. What are the items in the foresighting need?

  **Student (Nisha):** Environmental complexity and environmental volatility.

  **Professor:** What are they?

  **Student (Nisha):** Like the... how complicated or your industry or the business environment you are...

  **Professor:** Understand. But did anyone bother to go and get the index items for it? Did anyone? Can anyone tell what that complexity is? Volatility is? The items used?

  **Student:** Uh, complexity is how the surrounding affects the...

  **Professor:** True. But what are the items used to gauge your company... to your industry?

  **Professor:** So this is why as an analyst when you read report, you need to get to the details. They refer to another paper. You need to go and dig deeper to understand what are the items if you were to do the same for your company. So as I told you as intelligence analyst, sometimes you need to dig, dig, dig, dig. Devil is in the details for you. Whether you like it or not. But the devil is not in the details for the decision maker. They need to get the bigger picture right. And they need to understand what it is, not get the details right. Okay? So when you look at references try to go deeper. That's part of being an intelligence analyst. Okay? So these are the different scales used by this paper. What René did is they didn't use all these items, they picked the most important from this and they used. Because they used 15 items or something that's what is mentioned in the paper. Okay? So you need to get into the details. What else?

  **Professor:** So this is what is the five dimensions of maturity. And there are... you know... there is more detail into it which we'll talk about in the last week of the lecture because this determines the maturity level. We do what is called as Foresighting Audit wherein we'll talk the details of it. But I'm not covering it today. All right? So and then you talk about the needs based on these items. Anything else that you need to be aware of of as tech... intelligence agents? There's one more thing. I told you that the 3 Ps. The decision maker is enough for him to know what the 3 Ps are. But the analyst should know the details of it.

  **教授：** 好的。作为一名分析师，还有什么？

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 我应该把什么样的指数放入衡量标准中？数据源是什么？因为普通的财务指数……报表、资产负债表行不通。那么我们应该寻找什么样的数据？

  **教授：** 是的。所以有人有答案吗？我不想展示这个，但是在关于成熟度的事情中有一件事。你知道成熟度是如何评估的。对吧？

  **全班：** 信息、方法……

  **教授：** 信息、方法、人员和网络、组织和文化。五个方面，对吧？每一个都有不同的项目。无论你喜不喜欢，作为一名分析师，你可能要重视这些东西。因为这也是你从 AI SG 那里学到的。成熟度水平，你需要做什么不同的指数。如果你的公司……例如，如果你在为 [Nisha] 咨询，她的案例非常有趣。如果她知道 AI 就绪指数并为客户做了那个，她的公司就不必丢脸了。对吧？

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 是的。

  **教授：** 如果她知道那个指数，如果她为客户做了那个。对吧？这种意识非常重要。有这个指数你可以做。同样在这里，为了评估前瞻成熟度，有五个不同的指数。那么前瞻需求呢？

  **教授：** 这是一个星级问题 [Chang Wom]。前瞻需求。是的。

  **学生：** [M.L.C.F] 和 [M.L.C.F]？

  **教授：** 是的。前瞻需求中的项目是什么？

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 环境复杂性和环境波动性。

  **教授：** 它们是什么？

  **学生 (Nisha)：** 就像……你的行业或商业环境有多复杂……

  **教授：** 明白了。但是有人费心去获取它的指数项目吗？有人吗？谁能告诉我那个复杂性是什么？波动性是什么？使用的项目是什么？

  **学生：** 呃，复杂性是周围环境如何影响……

  **教授：** 没错。但是用来评估你的公司……你的行业的项目是什么？

  **教授：** 这就是为什么作为一名分析师，当你阅读报告时，你需要深入细节。他们参考了另一篇论文。如果要在你的公司做同样的事情，你需要去深入挖掘以了解这些项目是什么。就像我告诉你的，作为情报分析师，有时你需要挖掘、挖掘、挖掘、挖掘。魔鬼就在细节中。无论你喜不喜欢。但对于决策者来说，魔鬼不在细节中。他们需要把握大局。他们需要理解它是什么，而不是纠结细节。好吗？所以当你看参考文献时，试着深入一点。这是作为情报分析师的一部分。好吗？所以这些是这篇论文使用的不同量表。René 做的是，他们没有使用所有这些项目，他们从中挑选了最重要的并使用了。因为他们使用了15个项目左右，这就是论文中提到的。好吗？所以你需要进入细节。还有什么？

  **教授：** 这就是成熟度的五个维度。而且还有……你知道……这其中有更多的细节，我们将在讲座的最后一周讨论，因为这决定了成熟度水平。我们会做所谓的“前瞻审计”（Foresighting Audit），我们会讨论其中的细节。但我今天不讲这部分。好吗？所以然后你会根据这些项目讨论需求。作为技术……情报人员，还有什么你需要意识到的吗？还有一件事。我告诉过你三个“P”。对于决策者来说，知道三个“P”是什么就足够了。但分析师应该知道其中的细节。

  **30:00 - 32:45: The 3 Ps of Foresight: Perceiving, Prospecting, and Probing**

  **Student:** Do you think [inaudible] concept... it's very hard to measure the force of one... like, it is always an intangible kind of concept. So, it's very hard to use a single factor to measure the result...

  **Professor:** You can, as an analyst, you... yeah, you need to be aware of different ways of measuring it, definitely. You should be aware of it. But that's not what I am talking about. What I am talking about is the 3 Ps that he was detailing. One is scanning the environment. That's very easy, right? You have people, you have repositories. Knowledge management is a very important aspect of technology intelligence because many times employees from different parts of the world, they scan, they put in the information which will be analyzed later as well.

  But when it comes to perceiving, we have what is called Technology Radar. For prospecting, we have Scenario Planning. For probing, we have what is called the CVC investments. Probing is very easy. CVC investment is what? You have money, you invest in a small company that's trying to come up with new products, POCs, and ideas. And then you wait and see whether the company is doing well in terms of their ideas, and then later acquire them and bring the technology in-house. That is CVC. How many of you have done this course, CVC investment, in our department, taught by VU? There is a course offered if you want. Corporate Venture Capital Investment course.

  Then Scenario Planning, I'll talk about in one of the weeks. But did anyone bother to know... when you come across these terms, did anyone bother to know Scenario Planning in the past? Scenario Analysis?

  **Student:** In finance.

  **Professor:** In finance.

  **Student:** In IT.

  **Professor:** In IT. It's one and the same, right? Different context. Okay, we'll talk about it. But what is Radar? Did anyone see that nice chart and care to know what it is?

  **Student:** Maybe I am biased, but I looked at the type of innovation just because of the past module and then tried to make sense of it from what I already knew from that. Because I saw like, immediately I saw incremental and like technological recombination. But then relating it now, how does that relate to how it will affect the type of forecasting we do was pretty interesting. Because what if you are a radical innovation? How does that change your strategy then? Because obviously you don't want them to encroach on your type of innovation. But then does that differentiate you from incremental and...

  **Chinese Translation**

  **学生：** 您是否认为……[听不清] 概念……很难去衡量某种力量……就像，这总是一种无形的概念。所以，很难用单一因素来衡量结果……

  **教授：** 作为一名分析师，你可以……是的，你确实需要了解衡量它的不同方法，这毫无疑问。你应该了解这一点。但这并不是我现在要谈论的。我谈论的是他刚才详细阐述的“3P”。一个是扫描环境。这很容易，对吧？你有人员，你有知识库。知识管理是技术情报的一个非常重要的方面，因为很多时候，来自世界各地的员工会进行扫描，并输入信息，这些信息稍后会被分析。

  但谈到“感知（Perceiving）”，我们有所谓的“技术雷达（Technology Radar）”。对于“展望（Prospecting）”，我们有“情景规划（Scenario Planning）”。对于“探索（Probing）”，我们有所谓的“企业风险投资（CVC Investments）”。探索很容易理解。企业风险投资是什么？你有资金，你投资一家试图推出新产品、概念验证（POC）和想法的小公司。然后你通过观察等待，看这家公司在想法方面是否表现良好，随后收购它们并将技术引入内部。这就是 CVC。你们中有多少人在我们系修过这门由 VU 教授的 CVC 投资课程？如果你们想学，有这就叫企业风险投资课程。

  至于情景规划，我会在其中一周讲到。但是有人费心去了解过吗……当你们遇到这些术语时，以前有人去了解过情景规划吗？情景分析？

  **学生：** 在金融领域。

  **教授：** 在金融领域。

  **学生：** 在 IT 领域。

  **教授：** 在 IT 领域。其实是一样的，对吧？只是背景不同。好的，我们会谈论它。但是什么是雷达？有人看过那个漂亮的图表并想知道它是什么吗？

  **学生：** 也许我有偏见，但我关注的是创新类型，仅仅是因为过去的模块，然后试图根据我从中已知的知识来理解它。因为我看到……我立刻看到了渐进式创新和技术重组。但现在将其联系起来，它如何关系到它将如何影响我们要做的预测类型，这非常有趣。因为如果你是激进式创新怎么办？那会如何改变你的策略？因为显然你不想让他们侵蚀你的创新类型。但这是否会将你与渐进式创新区分开来……

  **32:45 - 35:00: Technology Radar: From Signals to Strategy**

  **Professor:** Good thinking. But you need to know how this, the Radar, is coined. Anybody who has seen Radar before? This Radar, Technology Radar, actually originated from Cisco, the company. Anyone has done it? Okay. Radar is a powerful... I'll maybe, since you are not aware, I'll have a class on Radar itself. But Radar goes through all the three steps that are mentioned out here: the perceiving and prospecting. It basically... what it does is, in Radar, you scan the environment. Like what happened in Carlson's article, the second step. Go and scan the environment for information. And once you scan the environment, you start analyzing for what are the strong signals, what are the weak signals. And what are worth investing, what are not worth investing.

  If some things you feel as a group is worth investing further, you are going to probe into them. Invest money. "Oh, this, for example, AI is going to kill me down the line. So let me park certain portion of my budget into AI so that tomorrow I'm not going to be killed. I am ready kind of." If certain things you don't get clear signals... like for Blockchain, you feel like, "I don't know whether I should invest in." What you do is you start monitoring them.

  So based on the scan signals that comes in, you try to prioritize your R&D strategy into different buckets. Some are of immediate value, some are of long-term value, and some are of very futuristic one. Okay? Very futuristic one... maybe you are not bidding today, but it can come and kill you later. So you want to monitor it to see *when* I need to invest in it.

  Immediate one: high importance. Go put it there so that you are not being killed. Moderate one: they are not of that great importance. So what I'll do is I'll have a class to tell you how the Cisco Radar is all about. And what is more interesting is all the technology intelligence process that you undertake is a powerful communication tool.

  **Chinese Translation**

  **教授：** 很好的思考。但你需要知道这个“雷达”是如何构思出来的。有人以前见过雷达吗？这个雷达，技术雷达，实际上源自思科（Cisco）这家公司。有人做过吗？好吧。雷达是一个强大的……也许，既然你们不了解，我会专门上一节关于雷达的课。但雷达经历了这里提到的所有三个步骤：感知和展望。基本上……它所做的是，在雷达中，你扫描环境。就像卡尔森（Carlson）文章中提到的第二步。去扫描环境以获取信息。一旦你扫描了环境，你就开始分析哪些是强信号，哪些是弱信号。哪些值得投资，哪些不值得投资。

  如果作为一个团队，你们觉得某些东西值得进一步投资，你们就会去探索它们。投入资金。“噢，例如，人工智能（AI）将来会扼杀我。所以我要把一部分预算投入到 AI 中，这样明天我就不会被淘汰。我已经做好了某种准备。”如果某些事情你没有得到明确的信号……比如区块链，你觉得，“我不知道是否应该投资。”你要做的就是开始监控它们。

  因此，基于进入的扫描信号，你试图将你的研发策略按优先级分入不同的桶中。有些具有即时价值，有些具有长期价值，还有一些是非常未来导向的。好吗？非常未来导向的……也许你今天不押注，但它以后可能会来扼杀你。所以你要监控它，看看我*何时*需要投资它。

  即时的：高度重要。去把它放在那里，这样你就不会被淘汰。中等的：它们没那么重要。所以我将上一节课告诉你们思科雷达是怎么回事。更有趣的是，你们进行的所有技术情报过程都是一个强大的沟通工具。

  **35:00 - 37:00: Interpreting the Radar: Projects and Strategic Choices**

  **Professor:** If you were to present the Radar of your company, it will showcase all the... you know, the blocks and triangles that you see, they are nothing but projects of a firm. And the projects are split into whether they are radical, like what she said, incremental... whether they have immediate business potential or long-term business potential... how important they are... and how close they are. This is the TRL level that Seng Meng was mentioning. Some are market-ready projects and some are very basic projects.

  And in just a look at this Radar, you know if your company is being currently profitable as well as futuristic or not. Because if they haven't invested anything in the peripheral, which means they are not being futuristic. Right? And it could be a strategic choice of company saying, "I don't want to invest in anything basic. I am very applied in nature because I care about bread and butter." Okay. If it is a strategic choice, it's okay. Then you cannot expect to be in the forefront of innovation if you have projects only in this one... in this part. Right?

  So as a company, you will know where you stand in terms of whether your projects are only here or are there. Are they all radical in nature? Which means radical projects will take a long time for you to fetch money, but it can fetch a lot of money. Are you happy with that? Some companies decide to do that. Especially those working on rare diseases in biopharma industry. It takes a long time, right? Or blockbuster drugs, right? It takes a long time sometimes, but it fetches you a lot of money.

  **Chinese Translation**

  **教授：** 如果你要展示你公司的雷达，它将展示所有的……你知道，你看到的那些方块和三角形，它们不过是一家公司的项目。这些项目被分为是激进的（就像她说的），还是渐进的……它们是具有即时商业潜力还是长期商业潜力……它们有多重要……以及它们有多接近。这就是 Seng Meng 提到的技术就绪指数（TRL）水平。有些是市场就绪的项目，有些是非常基础的项目。

  仅仅看一眼这个雷达，你就知道你的公司目前是既盈利又面向未来，还是并非如此。因为如果他们没有在边缘领域投资任何东西，这意味着他们没有面向未来。对吧？这可能是公司的一种战略选择，说：“我不想投资任何基础的东西。我本质上非常注重应用，因为我关心的是生计（面包和黄油）。”好吧。如果是战略选择，那没问题。那么，如果你的项目只在这个……在这个部分，你就不能指望处于创新的前沿。对吧？

  所以作为一家公司，你会知道自己的立场，即你的项目是只在这里还是在那里。它们本质上都是激进的吗？这意味着激进的项目需要很长时间才能为你带来资金，但它可以带来很多资金。你对此满意吗？有些公司决定这样做。特别是那些在生物制药行业研究罕见疾病的公司。这需要很长时间，对吧？或者重磅炸弹药物，对吧？有时这需要很长时间，但它会为你带来很多钱。

  **37:00 - 39:12: Wrapping Up Benchmarking and Advice for SMEs**

  **Professor:** And... um... it also talks about... you know... it also helps employees decide on which project they want to work on because knowledge management is also about employees choosing projects if they want to work on. If you are interested only in radical projects, probably you have to go look at the Radar and start looking at *who* is running the project and start approaching them as well. You know? A Radar is a powerful communication tool as well as foresighting tool. Let me cover the details in one of the lessons because it's one of the tools as well.

  But as an intelligence analyst, when you went through this benchmarking report, a graph like this should have piqued your interest. You may not know the details or you need not know the details of it, but you need to understand what it is actually. That homework you should have done. Okay? That skill is something which you need to develop if you want to be an intelligence specialist. Everything cannot be... if everything is spit out to you like one of the students shared, right? Everything is shown in the form of an industry report published. By then it's too late. Okay? You need to probe and dig it and find it out.

  Um... I think that's pretty much about the benchmarking report. We have answered all the questions that are out there. I... I provide the answers here for those questions, but most of it we have discussed over it. Okay.

  This is the last slide. So what can small companies do if they cannot do foresighting? They look at at least their past blind spot where they have failed so that they don't repeat the mistake. And if there is an instructive analogy from... how do you... how do you pronounce it? Anala... analogy from other industries that you want to... because this is what happened in the case of... um... nanotechnology. What happened is when nanotechnology was picking up in the biopharma sector, they looked at what happened with genetically modified crops with another technology and then they tried to learn lessons from it to overcome the chasm in the industry. Okay? So you look for, you know, lessons from other industries, you learn from it.

  And what are your mavericks and outliers trying to tell you? What are the peripheral customers/clients thinking about? This is where your government organizations can help you in helping SMEs. And who in the industry is skilled at picking up weak signals and acting on them before everyone does? As a small and medium enterprise, if you can't invest in foresighting, it is okay. But closely monitor another company which is in the forefront of innovation and closely follow them. That's good enough. That's just a lesson for small and medium enterprises. That's it for today.

  **Chinese Translation**

  **教授：** 而且……嗯……它还谈到了……你知道……它还可以帮助员工决定他们想参与哪个项目，因为知识管理也关乎员工选择他们想做的项目。如果你只对激进的项目感兴趣，可能你就得去看看雷达，开始关注*谁*在负责这个项目，并开始接触他们。你知道吗？雷达既是一个强大的沟通工具，也是一个预测工具。我会在其中一节课中详细介绍，因为它也是一种工具。

  但作为一名情报分析师，当你阅读这份基准报告时，像这样的图表应该已经引起了你的兴趣。你可能不知道细节，或者你不必知道细节，但你需要理解它实际上是什么。那个功课你应该已经做过了。好吗？如果你想成为一名情报专家，这种技能是你需要培养的。并非所有事情都能……如果所有事情都像刚才一位学生分享的那样直接喂给你，对吧？所有事情都以发布的行业报告形式展示。那时就已经太晚了。好吗？你需要探索、挖掘并找出它。

  嗯……我想关于基准报告的内容就差不多是这些了。我们已经回答了那里列出的所有问题。我……我在这里提供了这些问题的答案，但大部分我们都已经讨论过了。好的。

  这是最后一张幻灯片。那么，如果不做预测，小公司能做什么呢？他们至少要看看过去失败的盲点，以免重蹈覆辙。如果有一个来自……你怎么……你怎么发音？类……类比（Analogy）……来自其他行业的具有指导意义的类比，你想去……因为这就是在……嗯……纳米技术案例中发生的事情。当纳米技术在生物制药领域兴起时，他们查看了另一种技术在转基因作物上发生了什么，然后试图从中吸取教训，以跨越行业的鸿沟。好吗？所以你寻找，你知道的，来自其他行业的教训，并从中学习。

  还有，你的特立独行者（Mavericks）和局外人（Outliers）试图告诉你什么？边缘客户/委托人在想什么？这正是政府组织可以帮助中小企业（SME）的地方。行业中谁擅长捕捉微弱信号并在所有人之前采取行动？作为一家中小企业，如果你不能投资于预测，那没关系。但要密切关注另一家处于创新前沿的公司，并紧跟他们。这就足够了。这只是给中小企业的一个教训。今天就到这里。

  **40:00 - 41:15: Conclusion of Benchmarking and Group Formation Logistics**

  **Professor:** Okay, so that's benchmarking. It's one report, but it teaches all the skills needed for foresighting at all levels. Okay?

  If there are any questions, I'll be happy to answer. The webcast is out there. By the way, there are some students who want to join other groups. So if groups are looking for more members, you can post it on the forum seeking groupmates, and others can join. Use the forum to discuss that. If not, those groups willing to take in more students, please raise your hand; the person can approach you now itself.

  But it's not mandatory for you to form groups right now. Take your time to see who is asking, who is performing, and then form the groups, mark you. Alright? Okay.

  **Chinese Translation**

  **教授：** 好的，这就是基准测试。虽然这只是一份报告，但它教授了各级预测所需的所有技能。好吗？

  如果有任何问题，我很乐意回答。网络直播已经发布了。顺便说一下，有些学生想加入其他小组。所以，如果有些小组正在寻找更多成员，你们可以在论坛上发布寻找组员的帖子，其他人可以加入。请使用论坛讨论这个问题。如果没有在论坛上讨论，那些愿意接收更多学生的小组，请举手；想加入的同学现在就可以直接找你们。

  但是，并不强制要求你们现在就组建小组。花点时间看看谁在提问，谁表现得好，然后再组建小组，请记住这一点。好吗？好的。

# Syllabus
## Course Description
  Successful R&D engineers and managers should have the foresight to anticipate and drive technological changes and convert them into strategic assets to organizations. This course will equip students with technology forecasting, intelligence and foresighting skills, make use of the foresight to generate strategic intellectual assets and realize value from them to succeed in competitive environment. Effective collection and transformation of information into intelligence requires awareness of enterprise niches and alternatives, as well as the search and analytical skills of data and information. The course will emphasize these skills and impart a thorough understanding business & technology related strategic frameworks.
## Welcome to the course!
  Welcome to MT5010!

  I am Annapoornima Subramanian, lecturer for MT5010 for this semester.

  We all know that organizations need to develop insights into future alternatives and be relevant in order to enjoy sustained competitive advantage. Doing so is more critical for R&D intensive organizations as firms in high-technology industries are constantly threatened with technological discontinuities. Therefore, this module aims to equip students with strategic insights and analytical skills of technology forecasting & intelligence that are essential for high-tech companies to survive in a transient and competitive environment. Effective technological intelligence and forecasting requires a comprehensive awareness of enterprise niches and alternatives, analytical skills of data/information, knowledge management and considerations to organizational structures. Hence, this module covers range of topics including technology intelligence (a) mission (b) structure (c) processes, (d) management, and (e) tools.  Thus, apart from introducing the theory and practice of technology forecasting & intelligence, the module will provide hands-on training on technology intelligence and forecasting tools.
## Grading Components & Details
  The grading requirement involves both individual and group work. Individual work includes class participation, and a logbook submission. Group work includes a group project (either of a company of your choice or Straumann/NRP cases provided in Canvas).

  The breakdown of grading components is as follows

  Grading

  Individual Component (60%)

  Class Participation 30%
  Logbook  (26 April, 9pm) 30%
  Group Component (40%)
  Group Project or Straumann case or Singapore's NRP (15 April) 40%                                     
  Description

  Individual Component

  Class Participation (30% grade): Students are expected to analyze the readings and cases and contribute to class discussion. You are graded on quality rather than quantity. I will be inviting many guest lecturers for this module. Asking interesting questions during the guest lectures is a way to improve your class participation score.

  Logbook (30% grade): Throughout the semester, I will assign articles for discussion in each class and facilitate group activities. You are required to maintain a logbook that documents the discussion components from each session. Students who have taken MT5007 may already be familiar with this requirement; for those who haven't, I will provide a detailed briefing during the first lecture.

  Your logbook should focus on capturing the key discussion points from each class and connecting these insights to real-world applications. You need to cover a maximum of five topics in your logbook. The submission deadline is April 26, 2026.

  Group Component

  Group Project (40% grade)  Students are expected to form groups by themselves. Groups are expected to make a presentation and it can take one of the following two forms. Please note that there is no need to submit report. Just presentation is enough and slides are to be submitted to Canvas. Each group will have to make a presentation for 15-18 mins. This will be followed by Q&A for 2 mins.

  Technology Intelligence practices in your organization/If you were to initiate Technology Intelligence activities in your organization, how would you go about structuring and executing them.
  Presentation on Technological Intelligence Activities in a SME called Straumann. This case is published in a book. Groups need to understand the TI journey of Straumann and present their critical analysis of the same.
  Presentation on the Strategic foresight activities of Singapore’s National Robotics Programme (NRP). This case is published in a book. Groups need to understand the journey of Strategic Foresight Journey of NRP Singapore and present their critical analysis of the same.
