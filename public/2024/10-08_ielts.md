# Advices
## Writing
1. 整体结构总分总，开篇观点亮得直接明了一些，你结尾那段写的就挺好，放第一段还蛮合适，结尾再呼应一下就好，要有凤头豹尾的感觉；
2. 每一段观点+论证，观点要鲜明，论证要有逻辑。要是选择举例，例子要具体有力
3. 语法错误这个问题注意注意，有些明显一点的要是被逮到了很不划算；句式还可以更丰富一点，虚拟语气、强调句式、倒装、独立主格结构这些，可以有意识地逼自己用一用
4. 还有时态的问题，一般来说通篇一般现在时，除了特殊句式和你举例子可能用到过去时/过去完成时。像文章中突然蹦出来那个understood，阅卷人会觉得很出戏，是个扣分点
5. 句式变化还有一个思路，就是用否定表肯定。比方说你最后收尾的时候，再强调一下国内的福利也需要被重视，under no circumstances will domestic welfare and human well-beings be neglected

# Task 2
## Test 1
IELTS WRITING TASK 2:
You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.

Write about the following topic:

Some people argue that all experimentation on animals is bad and should be outlawed. However, others believe that important scientific discoveries can be made from animal experiments.

Can experimentation on animals be justified? Are there any alternatives?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.

Write at least 250 words.

Here's my essay. Give a score and some advice:
For scientific experimentation, there's no doubt that experimental animals play a crucial role. However, there are also voices stand for animal rights, that those were not justified. Personally, I think that some scientific discoveries using animals cannot be avoided, but still, we can limit the harmful methods.

There are areas where the live creature's reactions under experimental conditions are essential, like space travel, medical, or situations in which scientists are unsure about the danger. In those cases, unless we have any other alternatives, the sacrifices are not avoidable. On the other hand, it's not true all animal experiments should be harmful, some tests in biology like animal behavior learning, would just place them in a normal and peaceful situation.

Sometimes animals are just there as alternatives for real human beings. Only if animal experiments pass, further experimentation on human beings can take place. On those occasions, the only thing we can do is limit the harmful experiments.

Nowadays, as technology develops, there could be a way that animal experiments could be limited, especially with the development of robotics, monitoring, artificial intelligence, etc. In areas like space or deep ocean exploration, instead of animals, robots with modern monitoring can be used to record as much information as possible. For other fields like medical tests, the most developed artificial intelligence can be used to predict some results, thus reducing the harmful experiments on animals.

In conclusion, animal experiments are helpful for human beings and sometimes unavoidable, but we can keep the harmful ones under control.
## Test 2
IELTS writing task 2:
It is impossible to help all people around the world in need, so governments should focus on helping people in their own country, To what extent do you agree or disagree.

Here's my essay. Give a score and some advice:
It is unrealistic to lend a hand to all people who need help. at the government level, it is often debated whether they should only give attention to internal or international demands. In my opinion, for developed countries, it is essential to help other countries, but it should be after domestic issues handled.

In modern human society, countries or regions are not equally developed. Those governments with more prosperous economies should take more responsibilities, as we are all sharing the same society, despite different culture and religions, helping each other is the key to creating a better world. Recent years, as China built a deep relationship with Africa, it shows a win-win future for countries collaboration. Another example is that if some enormous disaster happens, in which a large amount of people would need help, countries usually would receive global favor.

On the other hand, happiness in one's own homeland is also important, it will lead to a stable government. Like personal situation, it’s better focus on our own issues before helping others. Additionally, under circumstances like large religion gap and different governing situation between countries , international assistances may suffer obstructions. Government from other countries may not understand what exactly the civil requirements. For instance, in helping African people, local tradition should be respected.

In conclusion, it is crucial governments from more developed regions should help others, on behalf of human beings, to achieve a better future. However, this kind of favor should under the condition that their most urgent domestic needs are fulfilled.
