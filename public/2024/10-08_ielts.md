# Advices
## Writing
  1. 整体结构总分总，开篇观点亮得直接明了一些，你结尾那段写的就挺好，放第一段还蛮合适，结尾再呼应一下就好，要有凤头豹尾的感觉；
  2. 每一段观点+论证，观点要鲜明，论证要有逻辑。要是选择举例，例子要具体有力
  3. 语法错误这个问题注意注意，有些明显一点的要是被逮到了很不划算；句式还可以更丰富一点，虚拟语气、强调句式、倒装、独立主格结构这些，可以有意识地逼自己用一用
  4. 还有时态的问题，一般来说通篇一般现在时，除了特殊句式和你举例子可能用到过去时/过去完成时。像文章中突然蹦出来那个understood，阅卷人会觉得很出戏，是个扣分点
  5. 句式变化还有一个思路，就是用否定表肯定。比方说你最后收尾的时候，再强调一下国内的福利也需要被重视，under no circumstances will domestic welfare and human well-beings be neglected

# Task 2
## Test 1
  IELTS WRITING TASK 2:
  You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.

  Write about the following topic:

  Some people argue that all experimentation on animals is bad and should be outlawed. However, others believe that important scientific discoveries can be made from animal experiments.

  Can experimentation on animals be justified? Are there any alternatives?

  Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.

  Write at least 250 words.

  Here's my essay. Give a score and some advice:
  For scientific experimentation, there's no doubt that experimental animals play a crucial role. However, there are also voices stand for animal rights, that those were not justified. Personally, I think that some scientific discoveries using animals cannot be avoided, but still, we can limit the harmful methods.

  There are areas where the live creature's reactions under experimental conditions are essential, like space travel, medical, or situations in which scientists are unsure about the danger. In those cases, unless we have any other alternatives, the sacrifices are not avoidable. On the other hand, it's not true all animal experiments should be harmful, some tests in biology like animal behavior learning, would just place them in a normal and peaceful situation.

  Sometimes animals are just there as alternatives for real human beings. Only if animal experiments pass, further experimentation on human beings can take place. On those occasions, the only thing we can do is limit the harmful experiments.

  Nowadays, as technology develops, there could be a way that animal experiments could be limited, especially with the development of robotics, monitoring, artificial intelligence, etc. In areas like space or deep ocean exploration, instead of animals, robots with modern monitoring can be used to record as much information as possible. For other fields like medical tests, the most developed artificial intelligence can be used to predict some results, thus reducing the harmful experiments on animals.

  In conclusion, animal experiments are helpful for human beings and sometimes unavoidable, but we can keep the harmful ones under control.

  It is impossible to help all people around the world in need, so governments should focus on helping people in their own country, To what extent do you agree or disagree.

  Here's my essay. Give a score and some advice:
  It is unrealistic to lend a hand to all people who need help. at the government level, it is often debated whether they should only give attention to internal or international demands. In my opinion, for developed countries, it is essential to help other countries, but it should be after domestic issues handled.

  In modern human society, countries or regions are not equally developed. Those governments with more prosperous economies should take more responsibilities, as we are all sharing the same society, despite different culture and religions, helping each other is the key to creating a better world. Recent years, as China built a deep relationship with Africa, it shows a win-win future for countries collaboration. Another example is that if some enormous disaster happens, in which a large amount of people would need help, countries usually would receive global favor.

  On the other hand, happiness in one's own homeland is also important, it will lead to a stable government. Like personal situation, it’s better focus on our own issues before helping others. Additionally, under circumstances like large religion gap and different governing situation between countries , international assistances may suffer obstructions. Government from other countries may not understand what exactly the civil requirements. For instance, in helping African people, local tradition should be respected.

  In conclusion, it is crucial governments from more developed regions should help others, on behalf of human beings, to achieve a better future. However, this kind of favor should under the condition that their most urgent domestic needs are fulfilled.

For instance, a popular tourist destination can generate substantial revenue that helps support local businesses and infrastructure.
  - **Reason 2** Moreover, tourism fosters cultural exchange and understanding. When people travel, they experience different cultures, traditions, and lifestyles, which can lead to greater tolerance and appreciation for diversity. This cultural interaction enriches both visitors and host communities.
  - **Counterpoint** While tourism can have positive impacts, it can also lead to challenges such as over-tourism, which can strain local resources and negatively affect the environment. Therefore, sustainable tourism practices are essential to balance economic benefits with environmental and cultural preservation.
  - **Conclusion** In conclusion, although tourism presents certain challenges, its economic benefits and potential for cultural exchange make it a crucial sector in today’s globalized world. Promoting sustainable tourism can ensure that we enjoy these advantages while protecting our planet and cultures for future generations.
## money and economy
  - **Introduction** When discussing significant societal factors, I believe that money and the economy are foundational to individual and collective well-being.
  - **Reason 1** Firstly, a stable economy is essential for job creation and financial security. When the economy is strong, businesses thrive, leading to more employment opportunities. For example, during periods of economic growth, unemployment rates typically decrease, allowing more people to achieve financial independence.
  - **Reason 2** Moreover, money facilitates trade and investment, which are critical for innovation and development. Access to capital allows entrepreneurs to start new ventures, contributing to technological advancements and improved living standards.
  - **Counterpoint** However, it’s important to recognize that an excessive focus on money can lead to inequality and social issues. While economic growth is vital, it should be accompanied by measures that ensure equitable distribution of wealth to prevent widening gaps between different social groups.
  - **Conclusion** In conclusion, while the economy and money are crucial for prosperity and innovation, it’s equally important to address the social implications of economic policies. A balanced approach can foster both economic growth and social equity, benefiting society as a whole.
## crime and law
  - **Introduction** When considering important societal elements, I believe that crime and law play a crucial role in maintaining social order and protecting citizens.
  - **Reason 1** Firstly, laws are essential for establishing clear guidelines for acceptable behavior. They help prevent crime by outlining the consequences of unlawful actions. For instance, laws against theft and violence deter individuals from committing these acts due to the fear of punishment.
  - **Reason 2** Moreover, a well-functioning legal system is vital for ensuring justice and fairness. It provides a mechanism for resolving disputes and protecting the rights of individuals. When people trust that the law will protect them, they are more likely to feel secure in their communities.
  - **Counterpoint** However, it’s important to acknowledge that laws must evolve to address changing societal norms and issues. In some cases, outdated laws can perpetuate inequality or injustice. For example, certain laws may disproportionately affect marginalized communities, highlighting the need for reform.
  - **Conclusion** In conclusion, while crime and law are fundamental to maintaining social order, it is essential to continually assess and improve the legal system to ensure it serves justice fairly. Balancing effective law enforcement with social equity can create a safer and more just society.
  - This structure effectively communicates the importance of crime and law while addressing potential challenges!

# Speaking
## Tips
  - 我当时准备口语的时候，最粗的划分就是，描述一个现象或者介绍一个地方（有题目是让描述你见过的最美丽的一片天空，这个要是不提前准备的话感觉很难的），描述一个人或者讲述一个故事（难忘的人或者事，这个主题准备一个，很多其他的题目都可以串过来），表达一个观点（这个可以跟写作一块准备，需要心里有提纲，叙述的时候讲逻辑）
  - **speak test 1** 我是分成了喜好类、选择类、频率类、经历类、观点类、方法类，这样的话题库不用一个一个问题，直接类别对应模板，只过这几大类就可以！差不多回答思路都是直接回答+解释原因+例子+感受，这样很节省时间
  - **speak test 2** 的话我是跟着周思奇结合自己的经历整理了6个大故事串整个题库，再每个大故事中定框架，比如我用周杰伦串了16个话题，接下来就可以定关于任务讲述的框架，按照任务本身描述eg基本信息+外貌+性格，我和任务的关系，相识过程+吸引我的点，感受eg他对我的影响，我认为他是一个怎样的人，用这样的逻辑思路准备就清晰很多！我们只需保证大框架不变，里面填充的内容可以根据具体内容随机灵活而变
  - **speak test 3** 我是分成了列举类、原因类、态度类、比较对比较类、优缺点类这集中类型，不管题目本身问的什么，基本都不会跳出这几种类型，实在想不起来说的，可以先用how can i describe it? / what is the word /well, let me think about it / well, it is a tough question. 先用口水话糊弄一下，也为自己正确思考时间。每天背周老师汇总的观点句和连接词，然后和老师对练加强输出，8天时间安排满满当当
  - **For Speaking Test 1**, maintaining the answer + reason + example + feeling pattern across the categories (preferences, choices, frequency, etc.) is a great way to ensure a consistent and well-rounded response.
  - **For Speaking Test 2**, the "story-based" preparation with flexible content based on the situation is clever, especially using someone like Jay Chou to link multiple topics.
  - **For Speaking Test 3**, focusing on response categories like listing, reasoning, and comparisons helps keep the answers focused. The filler phrases also buy time to organize your thoughts without breaking fluency.
  Sure! Here are some materials and example responses for IELTS Speaking Test 1, categorized by your framework:
