- 今天请教了ui/ ux的人， 我们可以用figma的AI自动输出实现基础ux，复杂的ux就需要详细定义交互然后生成代码再微调  https://www.figma.com/make/
- 如果对UI设计要求高， 可以额外app库再找素材参考 https://uinotes.com/app/492295814507031864

Just a reminder, as stated during the capstone briefing, groups should prepare:

  - Introduce your team (e.g., team composition, interest, skill sets, etc.)
  - Explain how your team intends to approach the project or challenge
  - Share the timeline for your proposed solution
  - Ask questions about the company’s project or challenge (to seek clarification if needed)

## Problem Statement
  - The National University of Singapore (NUS) community—students, faculty, and staff—faces diverse, intersecting challenges across mobility, timely access to services, community engagement, environmental sustainability, and campus safety etc. This project asks student teams to work with the NUS community to surface opportunities and to evaluate the OneMap API catalogue (e.g., search/geocoding, routing, static maps, thematic layers) in order to design meaningful, deployable geospatial products that enhance wellbeing.
  - Teams will follow a double-diamond design approach:
    - Discover (diverge) — Conduct user research with stakeholders to uncover a wide range of needs and candidate use cases, not limited to navigation.
    - Define (converge) — Prioritise and frame the most promising problem(s) using evidence and feasibility (including API capabilities and constraints).
    - Develop (diverge) — Ideate and prototype multiple AIassisted solutions powered by OneMap data.
    - Deliver (converge) — Select, test, and iterate on the strongest concept to a demonstrable prototype with an implementation pathway.
  - Success will be evidenced by clear wellbeing metrics (e.g., reduced time or stress for key tasks, increased access to support/services, higher perceived safety and satisfaction) and by adherence to PDPA, OneMap T&Cs, accessibility, and transparent data-use practices. Deliverables include a validated problem statement, API service selection rationale, prototype/demo, and an evaluation plan with measurable outcomes.
## Project Objective
  - The objective of this capstone project is to develop an AI-driven prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) that addresses a student-identified challenge within the NUS community, using the OneMap API to incorporate geospatial data. Through design thinking, students will collaborate with NUS stakeholders, students, staff or faculty, to define a problem and create a solution that enhances student life, staff productivity, community engagement, environmental sustainability, or campus safety. The project will result in a scalable, data-driven tool—such as a campus navigation app, a resource optimisation system, a sustainability tracking platform, or a safety alert system—that delivers measurable value to NUS.
## Project Scope
  - Design Thinking Process: Conduct interviews, surveys and workshops with NUS stakeholders, to identify a specific problem related to student life, staff productivity, community engagement, environmental sustainability or campus safety. This process will define the project’s problem statement and ensure alignment with NUS real needs.
  - Geospatial Integration: Utilise the OneMap API (https://www.onemap.gov.sg/apidocs/) to incorporate Singapore’s geospatial data, such as maps, location-based services, routing information or land use data, into the solution.
  - AI and Innovation Application: Develop an AI-driven prototype (e.g., using machine learning for predictive analytics, natural language processing for user interfaces or data visualisation for insights) that integrates geospatial data to address the identified problem.
  - Prototype Development: Deliver a functional MVP, such as a web or mobile application, that demonstrates the solution (e.g., a campus navigation tool, a staff scheduling optimiser, a sustainability dashboard or a locationbased safety alert system).
  - Evaluation and Testing: Validate the prototype’s effectiveness through user testing within the NUS community, using metrics like usability, efficiency, environmental impact or safety improvements, with iterative refinements based on feedback.
  - Deliverables: Provide a working prototype, a comprehensive written report detailing the design thinking process, methodology results and an oral presentation to showcase the solution to the sponsor.
  - Timeline: The project will be completed within one semester (approximately 4-6 months), with regular updates shared with the sponsor.
  - Sponsor Involvement: The sponsor is invited to provide feedback on the proposed problem statement, offer resources (e.g., additional data, cloud credits), or participate in milestone reviews. Optional mentorship to guide students on industry-relevant AI or geospatial applications is welcome.
## QA
  - **Project Scope & Integration**
    - Is the project primarily focused on enhancing campus services and user experience , or does it also include infrastructure-level applications such as facility planning or site selection?
      Response: As context, this project is an innovative initiative that encourages creative, high-impact solutions for the NUS community. The project sponsor would like to avoid overly prescriptive constraints so teams can explore diverse ideas, methods, and technologies, applying design thinking to discover and define a meaningful challenge. Project team can include as much as possible (within the required timeframe), as long as it is meaningful and impactful to NUS community.
    - How does this project relate to existing NUS platforms such as uNivUS, NUS Universe, or NUSafe?
      Response: There is no dependency with existing NUS platforms.
    - Are we expected to integrate with them, or design an independent prototype?
      Response: It will be an independent prototype.
    - Will teams have access to real campus data or APIs (e.g., OneMap + internal NUS datasets), or only to publicly available OneMap data?
      Response: UCI can provide the textual location data to the project team. Other data should come from publicly available sources, including OneMap public datasets.
  - **AI Applications & Technical Depth**
    - Beyond UI/UX and design thinking, what kind of AI applications are expected or encouraged?
      Response: Project team can explore using Large Language Model (LLM), Vision Language Model (VLM) and Agentic but not limited to these.
    - Predictive analytics (e.g., crowd flow, energy usage)?
      Response: Predictive analytics is encouraged if it directly supports the identified challenge and is feasible using the data available.
    - Personalized recommendations?
      Response: Personalised recommendations are encouraged if they directly support the identified challenge and can be implemented without sensitive personal data. Use contextual signals rather than individual profiles.
    - NLP or voice-based interaction?
      Response: NLP and/or voice-based interaction are encouraged if they clearly support the identified challenge and can be developed and evaluated in the prototype/MVP within the timeline.
    - Would it be acceptable to explore AI vision-based features, such as allowing users to photograph a campus building or sign, and automatically identify their current location for route guidance?
      Response: AI vision-based features are encouraged if they clearly support the identified challenge, use only public data and comply with privacy and security requirements.
    - Could the project include a community contribution element, where students upload campus photos or data to enrich the geospatial database (e.g., crowdsourced map updates)?
      Response: A community contribution element is encouraged if it directly supports the identified challenge, use only public/provided data and comply with privacy and security requirements.
  - **Evaluation**
    - Who will be the main supervising faculty or contact person for this project (from UCI or OneMap)?
      Response: There will be a POC from NUS UCI. You will meet them if your group selects this project for interview.
    - What are the key evaluation criteria — for instance, is greater emphasis placed on technical innovation, design thinking, or community impact?
      Response: The primary criterion is demonstrable meaningful impact and a clear value proposition for the NUS community. Design thinking and technical innovation are important as the methods to achieve the primary criterion, however any learning points originating from these are also important.
