1. Title should be “Reducing scam via new strategy”
3. ⁠To define problem upfront. Like: “Reduce the number of scam and financial impact of scam”. Including how fast to implement and what is the budget. (Be very clear)
4. ⁠just show a table for all the scam types (the first one he drew on board)
5. ⁠issue tree only for the 3 types selected
6. ⁠explain the table (one scam: all possible solution - do this for all 3 scams)
7. ⁠then explain the issues/solution that cuts across the 3 types.
8. ⁠explain that non of the solution is foolproof. Therefore we need to implement all the proposed solutions and not just 1 solution.

# group project
We have a group project this week, help us do some research for evidences and more detail on the idea
## requirements
  Everyone in the group must present.
  Each group has a maximum of 12 minutes.
  Focus on problem definition, issue tree, possible solutions, and how the chosen solution(s) will address the problem. Implementation is not required. The data do not need to be real but should be realistic and based on reasonable assumptions. The important thing is the logic.
  You need to “impress” your problem-owner. Imagine in real life, you are tasked with solving the particular problem by the owner (HR Director, CEO, marketing officer, etc. – depending on your chosen problem). After watching your presentation (or just by reading your slides), He/she needs to walk away with these:
  I have learned something new today (issue tree? Root causes of the problem? Novel solutions?)
  I am convinced/this is the right way to solve the problem.
  The analysis is logical and evidence-based
## Idea
  A. We have a scam situation in Singapore
  B. To address this problem, we look into the different types of scams and identify an area that we can potentially tackle.
  C. We should focus on type of scam of high impact with high money lost like but not limited to GOIS.
  D. We identity the current measures in place
  E. We have come up with some possible solutions to plug the gap
  F. We expect to decrease this type of scam by X%, and $X of money lost

The slide should follow our problem solving methods introduced in this class, especially the structure in `Topic 7 Rough Rapid Right - presentation.pdf` like Introduction, Conclusion, Define the problem (follow the MECE strategy), Solve the problem. **Slide should be all in English**. Use the course’s **“Rough, Rapid, Right”** narrative logic (from Topic 7) as the backbone.
That means we’ll create a **McKinsey-style ghost deck**: each slide’s headline = horizontal logic (the storyline), and the content = vertical logic (data + reasoning).

Below is the **recommended deck structure** (≈ 10 slides → 12 min, so each member can take 1–2).
Everything follows the analytical approach taught in your MT5021 materials (Problem Definition → Issue Tree → Possible Solutions → Impact).

## 🧭 Horizontal Logic (the narrative across slides)

**A. We have a scam problem threatening Singapore’s financial trust.**
**B. To understand it, we examine the current situation and data trends.**
**C. Investment and crypto scams cause the highest financial damage.**
**D. We must diagnose the root causes using an issue-tree framework.**
**E. Current counter-measures exist but critical gaps remain.**
**F. We propose a three-layered solution focusing on detection, friction, and accountability.**
**G. The proposed solution can realistically reduce monetary losses by ≈ 50 % in high-impact scams.**
**H. Next steps: pilot with banks + regulators and refine with behavioral data.**

---

## 🧩 Vertical Logic (contents per slide)

### **Slide 1 – Title / Motivation**

**Headline:** “S$1.1 billion lost to scams in 2024 – a growing national threat”
**Visuals:** bar chart of scam losses (2020–2025 uptrend).
**Key fact:** 55,810 cases (+10.8 %), S$1.1 billion lost.
**Take-away:** Problem is systemic; mere awareness is insufficient.

---

### **Slide 2 – Problem Definition (TOSCA + SMART)**

**Headline:** “Our challenge: cut high-impact scam losses by 50 % within 2 years.”
Use TOSCA elements:

* **Trouble:** Victims still transferring money after deception.
* **Owner:** National anti-scam taskforce (MAS + SPF + banks).
* **Success:** Halve high-value scam losses.
* **Constraints:** User privacy / transaction latency.
* **Actors:** Banks, telcos, social media, public.

---

### **Slide 3 – Current Situation**

**Headline:** “Despite new safeguards, scams keep evolving faster than defences.”
Visual: timeline (2022 SMS Sender ID Registry → 2025 Protection from Scams Act → real-time bank detection).
Data: 1H 2025 → S$456 m lost (+18 %), crypto scams ≈ S$81 m.
Insight: 86 % cases = self-effected transfers → behavioral weak spot.

---

### **Slide 4 – Focus Selection**

**Headline:** “Investment & crypto scams drive 40 % of total losses.”
Chart: pie of scam types (by loss).
Rationale: few cases but massive impact; realistic data for intervention; aligns with bank controls domain.

---

### **Slide 5 – Issue Tree**

**Headline:** “Why do victims still lose money to investment scams?”
Branches:

* **A. Human factors** (greed / optimism bias / poor literacy)
* **B. Scammer tactics** (AI deepfake impersonation, fake dashboards)
* **C. System gaps** (slow detection, cross-border crypto, no liability)
* **D. Platform exposure** (social media ads / influencers)
  Mark the *red boxes* (A2, B1, C1) as “high-impact, addressable areas”.

---

### **Slide 6 – Existing Measures**

**Headline:** “Singapore’s multi-layered defence – effective but leaky.”
Table comparing measures → ScamShield app, real-time fraud framework, Restriction Orders, MAS rules.
Right column = Gap: lag in response, crypto out of reach, user resistance.

---

### **Slide 7 – Solution Overview**

**Headline:** “Three-layered approach to plug the critical gaps.”
Visual: three circles.
1️⃣ **Smart Friction** (behavioural pause in banking apps)
2️⃣ **AI-driven Scam Intelligence Hub** (banks + telcos + platforms share signals)
3️⃣ **Platform Accountability Framework** (certify investment ads; fine non-compliance)

---

### **Slide 8 – How Solutions Address Root Causes**

**Headline:** “Each solution targets a different root of the problem.”
Matrix:

* Smart Friction → A1 + C1 (Self-transfer intercept)
* AI Hub → B1 + C1 (Fraud signal detection)
* Platform Regulation → B3 + D1 (Funnel reduction).
  Add quick examples: risk prompt UI mock-up, real-time data flow diagram.

---

### **Slide 9 – Expected Impact & Assumptions**

**Headline:** “Projected 50 % loss reduction in high-value scams = ≈ S$60 million savings annually.”
Show simple model:
baseline S$120 m loss → post-solution S$60 m.
Note assumptions: 30 % cut from friction + 20 % from signal hub + 10 % from platform curation (overlap adjusted).
Quote: “Turning the right knobs on the right-hand side moves the needle on losses.” (links to Topic 6 logic).

---

### **Slide 10 – Next Steps / Call to Action**

**Headline:** “Pilot, measure, scale – toward a smarter anti-scam ecosystem.”
Steps:

1. Pilot with one bank + IMDA + MAS taskforce (3 months).
2. Track metrics: intercept rate, false positive rate, user feedback.
3. Refine with Design Thinking (Topic 4) → empathize with victims.
   End quote (aligning with “Rough Rapid Right”):

   This is the perfect next step. A presentation generator needs a detailed, slide-by-slide blueprint.

   Here is a comprehensive 12-slide prompt. [cite_start]It is structured to follow your professor's guide [cite: 2] [cite_start]by turning your dense business plan into a "high-level story" [cite: 20] [cite_start]that is "simple and relevant"[cite: 19]. I have included the slide title, the *exact* on-slide text, a visual concept, and the core talking points (your script) for each slide.

### **Slide 1 – Title**

### **Slide 2 – Scam Landscape & Issue Tree Overview**

**Purpose:** orient the audience; show how all scam types connect under one logic tree before you zoom in on three.

**Horizontal logic headline:**
“Scam losses in Singapore stem from multiple interacting factors — human, technical, systemic, and platform.”

**Vertical logic (content):**

* Short table: all eight scam categories (GOI, Job, Investment, Insurance, E-commerce, Loan/Phishing/Love, etc.).
* Indicate **focus area = 3 types** (Gov’t Official Impersonation, Investment, Insurance) highlighted in color.
* Add a simple overview issue-tree (level 2: 1. Targeting 2. Lure Creation 3. Contact / Delivery 4. Engagement / Social Engineering 5. Exploitation (Victim Action) 6. Control / Persistence 7. Monetisation / Extraction 8. Cover-up / Closure).
* Optional: one data point from the *Annual Scams and Cybercrime Brief 2024* (e.g., “Top 3 scam types account for > 70 % of monetary losses”).

**Speaker’s angle:** emphasize **MECE** breakdown and the rationale for selecting these 3 types (high impact × high loss × feasible intervention).

---

### **Slide 3 - The Problem We Aim to solve**

### **Slide 4 – Primary Cause Matrix Across 3 Focus Scams**

**Purpose:** bridge from overview to deep-dive; prepare audience for individual trees.

**Horizontal logic headline:**
“Each major scam type is driven by distinct yet overlapping root-cause domains.”

**Vertical logic (content):**
- Issue tree first level including these 3 scame types (GOI / Investment / Insurance).
- Introduce the 8 root causes (1. Targeting 2. Lure Creation 3. Contact / Delivery 4. Engagement / Social Engineering 5. Exploitation (Victim Action) 6. Control / Persistence 7. Monetisation / Extraction 8. Cover-up / Closure)

* Visually connect this to the previous MECE tree (A–D) → show these as **entry points for deeper analysis**.

---

### **Slide 5 – Detailed Issue Tree #1: Government Official Impersonation Scam**

**Horizontal logic headline:**
“Fear + authority bias × technological spoofing → voluntary fund transfer.”

**Vertical logic:**

* Root causes: lack of verification mechanisms, public fear, fragmented fund-freeze response.

---

### **Slide 6 – Detailed Issue Tree #2: Investment / Crypto Scam**

**Horizontal logic headline:**
“Greed and social proof amplified by digital platform algorithms.”

**Vertical logic:**

* Stages: Contact (via ads) → Manipulation (unrealistic returns / fake consultants) → Transaction (crypto wallet transfer) → Aftermath (no recourse).
* Root causes: weak ad screening, low financial literacy, AI deepfakes, untraceable wallets.
* Highlight the “cross-border coordination & crypto anonymity” problem as a systemic gap.

---

### **Slide 7 – Detailed Issue Tree #3: Insurance Scam**

**Horizontal logic headline:**
“Exploiting trust in regulated institutions through data leakage and look-alike channels.”

**Vertical logic:**

* Stages: Targeting (policyholder data leak) → Lure (fake policy quotation) → Contact (fake agent call) → Payment (fake premium site).
* Root causes: insufficient data privacy controls, poor consumer education, unverified digital sales platforms.
* Use the *Annual Scams and Cybercrime Brief 2024* figure on insurance losses (≈ S$ 16 million, ↑ 20 %) to quantify impact.

Excellent — your outline already mirrors the *Rough → Rapid → Right* logic taught in Topic 7:
start from **analysis (issue tree)** → move to **solution mapping** → end with **impact and implementation**.
Here’s a refined, professional-level structure for **Slides 6–10**, with content logic, visuals, and data pointers linked to your uploaded files (*Scam Solutions.docx*, *Scam Kill Chain.docx*, *Annual Scams and Cybercrime Brief 2024*).

## 🟦 **Slide 9 – Deep Dive into Key Solutions + Root-Cause Mapping**

**Purpose:** prove causality—each proposed measure directly attacks a defined root cause.

**Horizontal headline:**

> “Each flagship solution targets a specific failure point in the scam kill chain.”

**Structure (4 mini-sections or quadrants):**

| Solution                                    | Description                                                               | Targeted Root Cause (from Issue Tree)                  | Implementation Actors      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **SP/CP Caller Verification (GovAuth API)** | Telcos & service providers authenticate government numbers before connect | “Caller ID spoofing”, “lack of verification protocol”  | IMDA + SP + CP + GovTech   |
| **Telecom/ISP Fraud Detection AI Hub**      | Shared signal pool of suspicious domains + phone numbers                  | “Fragmented detection & data-sharing”                  | IMDA + Telcos + Banks      |
| **Bank Cool-down Mechanism**                | 30-min hold or confirmation prompt for high-risk transfers                | “Funds moved before freeze”, “self-initiated transfer” | ABS + Major Banks          |
| **AI Agent Real-time Voice Companion**      | On-device agent detects scam-like speech patterns and prompts user        | “Fear trigger / authority bias / ignored warnings”     | Device OEM + GovTech + MAS |

**Visual option:** a *Solution Tree* linking each idea to the GOI / Investment / Insurance sub-branch where it fits.

| **2026 H1** | GovAuth API go-live across major telcos | ↓ 25 % GOI scams                        |
| **2026 H2** | Telecom AI Hub + AI Agent integration   | ↓ 50 % investment/insurance scam losses |

Use *Annual Scams and Cybercrime Brief 2024* data as baseline (e.g., S$1.1 b total loss → target cut by S$300 m within 12 months).

---

## 🟦 **Slide 11 – Roadmap Diagram & Quantitative Impact**

**Purpose:** visualize the roadmap and show measurable decline.

**Horizontal headline:**

> “Projected scam-loss reduction trajectory from 2025 H2 to 2026 H2.”

**Visual suggestion:**

* **X-axis:** time (2025 H2 → 2026 H2).
* **Y-axis:** total monetary loss (S$ millions).
* Plot baseline = 1.1 b; target = 0.8 b → 0.55 b.
* Annotate each milestone (Cool-down → GovAuth → AI Hub + Agent).
* Add “Cases prevented” bubble (e.g., 20 000 cases saved).

Include small infographic boxes:

* 💰 **Money saved:** ≈ S$ 300 million
* 👥 **Victims avoided:** ≈ 25 000
* 🏦 **Average transfer delay:** + 30 min = − 40 % fraud success

---

## 🟦 **Slide 12 – Economic and Social Impact**

**Purpose:** conclude with outcome relevance for government, financial sector, and citizens.

**Horizontal headline:**

> “Beyond prevention—economic savings and restoration of public trust.”

**Visuals & points:**

* **Economic impact diagram:** flow from *Reduced scam loss* → *Higher consumer confidence* → *Increased digital transaction volume*.

  * Example: +3 % increase in e-payment adoption = ≈ S$ 1.5 b annual economic stimulus.
* **Social impact bullets:**

  * Improved public trust in institutions
  * Lower psychological trauma among victims
  * Better financial literacy & cyber-hygiene
  * Stronger cross-agency collaboration (banks × telcos × regulators)

End with a simple statement slide:

> “By 2026 H2, Singapore can halve scam losses through integrated human-tech-system interventions.”
