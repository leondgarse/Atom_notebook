We now have a task for creating this: "State your hypotheses (if we do X, then we get Y, where y is a data driven outcome) and propose an experiment to test"
It's for how we sell our product, and the process is:
```
Become aware of problem​ -> Search​ -> Compare​ -> Purchase​ -> Use​ -> Re-purchase​
```
which is
- Become aware of problem: How do you help them become aware
- Search: How do you ensure that when and where they search, they find you
- Compare: How do you help them differentiate so that they choose you
- Purchase: How do you help them buy
- Use: How do you help get maximum value and delight from use
- Re-Purchase / Refer: How do you get them to buy again or refer

It should be one hypothese following one experiment for each of them

  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

  Singapore Launches National Pharmacy Workforce Transformation to Address Urgent Manpower Crisis Affecting Patient Care



  Singapore, 17 October 2025 – Singapore’s hospital and community pharmacy leaders face a critical shortage of pharmacists and technicians, with nearly 500 unfilled vacancies as of mid-2025. This shortage stretches frontline staff, increasing workload stress, risking medication errors, and lengthening patient wait times. Younger pharmacy professionals often leave seeking balanced workloads and meaningful career growth, compounding the crisis.

  Currently, pharmacists spend up to 80% of their time on manual dispensing and administrative tasks, leaving little room for patient counseling or clinical care. This imbalance is a significant pain point validated through extensive interviews and frontline feedback across healthcare clusters.

  Recognizing this urgent need, the Ministry of Health and key healthcare institutions are launching a national initiative to transform pharmacy operations. The program will introduce intelligent automation — expanding robotic dispensing, RFID-enabled logistics, and automated packaging — integrated with AI-driven workforce planning. These technologies aim to cut manual workloads by over 60%, reduce prescription wait times by up to 50%, and significantly improve medication safety.

  Pilot sites have demonstrated potential to unlock capacity equivalent to adding over 1,000 full-time roles without increasing headcount, allowing pharmacists to focus on direct patient care and clinical services. The initiative promises annual operational savings between S$50 million and S$100 million by 2030, reinforcing the resilience and sustainability of pharmacy services amid rising healthcare demands.

  “This transformation responds directly to the day-to-day challenges faced by our pharmacy teams and patients,” said Dr. Lim Swee Hong, Chief Pharmacist at MOH. “By streamlining routine tasks with technology, we empower pharmacists to deliver safer, faster, and more meaningful care.”

## Pharmacy Workforce Transformation 7V FAQ
  Pharmacy Workforce Transformation

  7V Business Validation FAQ

  Valued – Empathy

  1. Who is your customer?
  Our customer is the pharmacy operations manager at large hospitals and retail chains in Singapore—pragmatic leaders responsible for teams of pharmacists and techs tasked with safe, efficient medication delivery to thousands of patients daily. Validation included over two dozen deep-dive interviews, on-site observation, and quantitative workflow analysis. Critical untested prediction: the impact of our solution in resource-constrained clinics and small chains outside the major hospital system.

  2. What are the customer pain points?
  CDIs revealed three main clusters of pain: (a) severe pharmacy workforce shortage (nearly 500 vacancies in 2025), (b) surging patient demand causing workflow and error risks, and (c) high burnout driving costly turnover and training cycles. Managers and staff spend most hours on manual tasks, leaving little time for patient counseling, and worry about recruitment, retention, and staff morale. Pivot: shifted solution focus from tech enablement to targeted alleviation of burnout, workflow friction, and retention.[1][2]

  3. How urgently/intensely do customers feel these pains?

  Staff Shortage: High Urgency/Intensity (9/10) – tracked by persistent vacancies and staff overtime.

  Burnout/Retention: High Urgency/Intensity (8/10) – measured by annual turnover rates (avg. 20%+).[2]

  Workflow Errors: High Urgency/Intensity (8/10) – tracked via reported incidents per thousand prescriptions, and peak-hour stress events. (Pilot data links pain directly to error spikes during busiest shifts.)

  4. Early Adopter? Current Behaviours and Journey
  Managers are "aware" of the crisis (daily report-outs and unfilled shifts), "attempting" fix with ad hoc hires, overtime, and basic process automation, but satisfaction is low. The pain peaks at afternoon/evening rush, when burnout and error risk spike. Attempts are not solving root problem—talent pipeline and workload redesign.

  5. Year 1 Traction Points and Pivot Guidance
  Monitor:

  Reduction in manual workflow hours per Rx

  Decline in dispensing errors

  Lowered attrition/turnover rates

  Shorter patient wait times

  Number of pharmacist-care interventions delivered daily
  Off-track signals: <15% improvement in error, attrition, or wait time after six months. Pivot by expanding change management support, increasing in-depth training, and adjusting deployment sequence for technology.


  Valuable – Greed

  1. Total Addressable Market (TAM), Value & Growth
  TAM: ~S$350M annually. Method: ~350 major hospital, clinic, chain locations × average relevant spend per year. Growth rate: ~6% per annum (per MOH 2025 estimates). Business model: license per site (S$20k–S$200k, scaled by size), annual service fee, plus optional consulting.[3]

  2. Beachhead Segment (size/value/growth rate)
  Top 5 hospital groups—S$55M TAM, 8% CAGR. Rationale: highest pain, proven tech readiness, existing executive relationships for fast access. Acquirability: very high.

  3. First Two Bowling Pin Segments

  Chain retail pharmacies: S$15M TAM, ~7% growth. Chosen for high automation need and rapid tech adoption.

  Private hospitals: S$25M TAM, ~5% growth. Rational selection post-hospital pilot.

  4. Market Share
  Goal: Capture 10% revenue share in Year 1, move to 30% by Year 3 (S$16.5M to S$49.5M ARR).

  5. Bottom-up Revenue Analysis & Key Constraints
  Sales team: 2–5 consultants, 1 marketer. Each can prospect 3–5 cluster deals/year (avg. S$1.1M deal size). Key constraints: solution complexity, buyer sluggishness, competing mandates (e.g. wage/salary policy changes).[4][5]
  Sales play: demo-driven pilots using live case data and ROI calculators, objection handling scripts, reference sites. Early experiment: split pilots (automation only vs. full workflow redesign).
  Common blockers: change aversion, legacy IT, procurement cycles. Solutions: executive engagement and phased pricing.

  6. Year 1 Traction Points for Pivot/Validation
  Monitor:

  Number of clusters onboarded

  Quarterly pilot conversion ratio

  Signed ARR and pipeline velocity
  If onboarding <6 clusters, conversion <30%, ARR <S$10M in first year, trigger solution refresh or more aggressive evangelism (conference showcases, testimonial video playbooks).


  Valid – Belief

  Solution effectiveness proven by pilot sites (manual labor reduced 70%, errors dropped 33%). Fully MOH-compliant and mapped to National Pharmacy Strategy. Features delight users: flexible automation, AI-driven staff scheduling, real-time KPIs. Remaining to validate: scalability in small clinics, full pharmacy technician adoption.[6][7][2]


  Valunique – Sustainable Defence

  Defensible advantage: proprietary AI+automation workflow, direct MOH partnerships, and proven cluster outcome data. Competitors lack both Singapore-mandated compliance and direct-clinical integration. Early local anchoring is a strategic moat.

  Value Chain – Relevant

  Delivery model pairs deep onboarding (on-site and remote) with tailored process mapping for each client. Tech and change management delivered by BCG and NCS partners. All value-chain touchpoints validated for real pharmacist experience, not just IT hand-offs. Continuous feedback via dashboard, rapid support.


  Valence – Trust

  Leadership: transformation specialists, senior pharmacy managers, pharmacists from pilot clusters, supported by MOH advisory. Role coverage: strategy, analytics, operations, tech, and frontline coaching. Built-in governance, transparent reviews, and track record in healthcare transformation foster trust.

  Valuation – Returns

  ROI: S$25–50M savings/year per cluster, payback <3 years, 35%+ gross margins, de-risked through pilot anchors. Strategic, recurring revenue stream and export potential. Attractive returns justify capital commitments and long-term partnership with Singapore healthcare leaders.
