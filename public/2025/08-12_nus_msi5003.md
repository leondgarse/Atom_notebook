  - The Golden Circle Model (Why → How → What) provides a strategic thinking path from the inside out
    - Start With Why: People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. Start with WHY.
    - The Lean Startup: The Lean Startup is about building companies that learn fast, test assumptions early, and pivot quickly toward sustainable growth.
    - Crossing the Chasm: To cross the chasm, focus all efforts on a niche market, deliver a complete solution, and then leverage that success to expand into the mainstream.


    * *Start With Why* corresponds to **Discover / Define stage, finding meaning and core problems**.
    * *The Lean Startup* corresponds to **Develop stage, quickly experimenting solutions through MVPs**.
    * *Crossing the Chasm* corresponds to **Deliver stage, scaling solutions and entering the mainstream market**.
  - His Pains → Goals → Behaviours all reinforce a tight story of *high urgency, high willingness to pay, already experimenting with solutions*.
  - Next step in WBT: we can use this Persona to frame a **Customer Hypothesis** and draft discovery interview questions.
  - facts + behaviors -> customer hypotheses, pains + goals -> problem
  - persona experiments
    - experiences tell true -> move to predictions and confirm -> pick another riskiest prediction
    - experiences tell false -> move to predictions and remove related one -> move to hypotheses and remove one problem hypotheses -> move to persona and remove the goal and pain -> leave the behavior because no evidence it's wrong -> move to hypotheses and put a new problem hypotheses -> move to predictions and put a new prediction -> more experiments
  - **share learning process of pivot of persona**
  - [The rule of customer interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZYntTU3JW4)
    - no pitching
    - no "Ice Cream" questions
    - Pull, don't push
    - "N of 1" is not proof
    - Past behavior -> future behavior
    - Ideal self vs actual self
    - stories are better than statements

  - **The Mom Test**. It’s called The Mom Test because it leads to questions that even your mom can’t lie to you about. When you do it right, they won’t even know you have an idea. Rule of thumb: Customer conversations are bad by default. It’s your job to fix them.
    1. Talk about their life instead of your idea
    2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
    3. Talk less and listen more

  - customer interview
    1. qualify fast
    2. do the work to create a script! but don't feel stuck to the script
    3. intro & outro
    4. avoid yes / no (but give yourself a break)
    5. and, what else... Is there anything else? Is there anyone else?

  - when can you break out of customer validation and start solution validation?

  Dear students,

  We hope you found yesterday's class engaging and helpful! Here are some updates from yesterday, for the week:
  1. Week 4 slides have been uploaded in the usual Files tab of Canvas!

  2. Please copy your profile from the Week 1 Miro board (on the right side of the board) and paste it in your own group's board, so the teaching team can easily identify who is included in the board!

  3. Please create a short deck of slides on your Miro boards to present to the class next week, about the updates to your customer validation interviews between yesterday and the next class. Each group will present their updates next class!

  Feel free to include some photos of your interviews/interviewees. You are allowed to anonymity your interviewees by censoring their faces, but a brief profile of each interviewee would be strongly encouraged!
  4. Reminders to complete your class participation submission 2 by next week! The teaching team has decided to EXTEND the deadline for submission 2, to the end of next week (14 September, 2359) for those who would like to edit their work based on next week's presentations.

  5.  There has been some reorganizing of the files in Canvas, so please note that readings/videos to watch will be in the "In Class Readings and Videos" folder!


  Thank you and see you all next week!

## Problem solution
  - problem canvas: [Y] will (Do we want to solve this?) [X] impact (if we solved this pain, how much value would it bring to customer?)
    - High will low impact, keep for later
    - High will high impact, build now <- at least 3 pains
    - all low will, hard pivot
## Solution Hypothesis
  - crazy 8's: draw 8 potential solutions to your customer's problem (sketch each idea within 1 of the 8 quadrants). Feel free to be absurd so long as it is "possible" (at least one)
## Solution tenets
  - affordable, simple to use <- customer requirement
  - scalable <- internal requirement
## Experimentation
  - two phases
    - Pitching - show your work. Does this resonate with the customer? keep your costs to zero.
    - Actualization - actually deliver the delight.
## Business validation mirros the phases of the scintific process
  - external FAQ starts from all the questions that we all know
  - internal FAQ "Value Promotion" - valued / valuable / valid / valunique / value chain / valence / valuation
## Value
  - top-down market size analysis and growth
    - Total Addressable Market (TAM)
    - Segment Addressable Market (SAM)
    - Segment Obtainable Market (SOM)

# Concepts
## Customer Validation
  - Persona -> customer & problem
  - Persona: choose a customer that your spider-sense tells you has an unresolved pain that you might reasonably solve for.
  - How do you identify an early adopter
    |                | Aware | Attempting |
    | -------------- | ----- | ---------- |
    | Early adopter  | Y     | Y          |
    | Early majority | Y     | N          |
    | Late majority  | N     | N          |
## Design Thinking
  - A **human-centered innovation methodology** that focuses on solving problems creatively and systematically, especially suitable for complex, uncertain challenges requiring cross-disciplinary collaboration.
  - The logic is: understand people first, then think of solutions — not the other way around.
  - **Core Characteristics**
    - **Human-Centered**: Understand user needs and pain points instead of assuming you already know.
    - **Collaborative**: Encourage participation from people of different backgrounds (designers, engineers, business staff, etc.).
    - **Iterative & Prototyping**: Use low-cost prototypes to test ideas, fail fast, and iterate quickly.
  - **Five Typical Stages** (flexible, can cycle or skip):
    - **Empathize**: Immerse into the user's life/context to understand motivations, needs, and pain points. Methods: interviews, observation, immersion.
    - **Define**: Based on research, refine the **core problem statement**. Example: “Busy urban professionals want healthy lunches but don’t have time to cook or wait for delivery.”
    - **Ideate**: Brainstorm lots of creative solutions without restrictions. Prioritize quantity before quality.
    - **Prototype**: Build low-cost, easily modifiable models (paper sketches, interactive prototypes, simple mock-ups). Make ideas visible and testable.
    - **Test**: Test prototypes with real users, collect feedback, and validate assumptions. May iterate back to earlier stages.
  - **Process Flow**
    ```java
    [Empathize] → [Define] → [Ideate] → [Prototype] → [Test]  
        ↑                                               ↓  
        └───────────── Iteration Loop ──────────────────┘
    ```
  - **Example**: Solving “students can’t easily find empty classrooms on campus.”
    1. **Empathize**: Interview students, discover they often waste time checking rooms without info.
    2. **Define**: Problem = “Students need a real-time, accurate empty classroom info tool.”
    3. **Ideate**: Brainstorm 20+ solutions (e.g., app, mini-program, digital screens on doors).
    4. **Prototype**: Create a simple interface in Figma simulating real-time classroom status.
    5. **Test**: Let 10 students try it. Feedback = add “remaining available time” feature → iterate.
  - **Difference from Lean Startup & Working Backwards**

  | Design Thinking        | Lean Startup              | Working Backwards              |
  | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
  | Focuses on **finding the right problem** by deeply exploring user needs | Focuses on **quickly validating business assumptions** | Focuses on **defining the end goal and working backwards** |
  | Emphasizes creativity and diverse solutions | Emphasizes MVP and market feedback | Emphasizes PR, FAQ, and user experience first |
  | Often used for early exploration and concept design | Often used for product validation and growth | Often used for product planning and roadmap |
## Lean Startup
  - Lean Startup is an entrepreneurial methodology proposed by Eric Ries. The core idea is **to validate business assumptions with minimal resources and speed, reducing waste and improving chances of success**.
  - Key concept: **Build → Measure → Learn** loop.
  - **Core Ideas**
    - **Don’t build a perfect product at first.** Start with an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** containing only core features, launch quickly at low cost.
    - **Validate assumptions with real user feedback** instead of founder intuition.
    - **Iterate quickly, reduce waste**. If assumptions are valid → continue; if invalid → **pivot** (change direction but keep valuable learnings).
  - **Goal:** Find a **sustainable business model** as quickly as possible.
    - **Build**: Quickly build MVP from assumptions.
    - **Measure**: Collect data via analytics, A/B tests, interviews.
    - **Learn**: Analyze results, decide to **persevere or pivot**.
  - **Example**: Food delivery app.
    - Traditional: 6 months building full features (ordering, payments, reviews, coupons, etc.) before launch.
    - Lean Startup: Week 1 build simple webpage → users see menu → order via chat → you deliver manually.
    * **Benefit**: If no orders, small loss; easy to pivot (change menu, switch target market).
  - **Advantages**
    - Saves time and money.
    - Best for uncertain projects with high validation cost.
    - Data-driven decisions over intuition.
## Working Backwards Framework
  - **Working Backwards** is an important Amazon methodology for product/project management.
  - **Core Idea:** Define the final customer experience and value first, then work backwards to figure out what to build. Not building features first and searching for users later.
  - Similar to Lean Startup (reduces waste, user-centered) but **approach differs**: Lean Startup = experiment quickly, Working Backwards = plan backwards from the end.
  - **Four Key Deliverables:**
    - **Press Release (PR):** Pretend product is launched, write a news article. Defines core value and user benefits. Must answer: What is the product? Who is it for? Why care?
    - **FAQ:**
      - External FAQ: Anticipated customer questions.
      - Internal FAQ: Questions from investors/team (tech feasibility, cost, business model).
      - Goal: expose problems early.
    - **User Experience (Visuals & Storyboards):** Simple sketches or flows showing how the product is used. Ensures all team members share the same vision.
    - **Start development only after PR & FAQ are reviewed and validated.**
  - **Process Flow**
    ```java
    [Imagine launch day success]  
           ↓  
    Write Press Release (PR)  
           ↓  
    Write FAQ (external + internal)  
           ↓  
    Create user experience sketches  
           ↓  
    Design & Develop & Test
    ```
  - **Example:** AI translation earphones.
    - **PR excerpt:** “LinguaGo Earbuds 2025 translate 60 languages in real-time while you speak, making cross-border communication effortless.”
    - **FAQ sample:**
      - Q: Translation delay? → A: <0.5 seconds.
      - Q: Price? → $299 standard / $399 premium.
    - **User Storyboard:** Wear earphones → Select language → Speak → Real-time translation → Supports dual mode.
  - **Difference from Lean Startup**

    | Lean Startup                     | Working Backwards                           |
    | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
    | **Quick MVP** → launch → iterate | **Define endpoint** (PR, FAQ, UX) before dev |
    | "Try and adjust"                 | "Think through first, then act"             |
    | Relies on market feedback        | Relies on upfront planning/thinking          |
    | Best for startups                | Best for resource-rich big projects          |
  - **Working Backwards tools**
    - **structured methods** that help teams move like scientists — making decisions based on evidence, not assumptions.
    - It's designed to mirror the scientific process: observation -> hypothesis -> experiment -> analysis.
      - **Observation → Persona** Create a detailed persona (a specific, semi-fictional customer) to observe who the real customer might be.
      - **Hypothesis → Customer & Problem Hypothesis** Form clear statements about what problem the customer has and why it matters.
      - **Experiment → Customer Discovery Interviews** Test your hypotheses by talking directly to customers, not by surveys or guesses.
      - **Analysis → Validation** Review results to check if the customer/problem/solution/business assumptions are valid.
    - So in short: WB tools are the *practical instruments* (Persona, Hypotheses, Customer Discovery, Validation) used in the **Working Backwards methodology** to guide innovation step by step, just like a lab experiment.
## Double Diamond
  - **Double Diamond model** (UK Design Council, 2005). Uses two diamonds to represent **divergence (expand) and convergence (narrow)**.
  - **Two spaces:**
    - **Problem Space**
      - **Discover (diverge):** Explore widely — users, market, environment. Gather insights.
      - **Define (converge):** Narrow insights to core problem statement.
    - **Solution Space**
      - **Develop (diverge):** Generate many solutions (brainstorm, prototyping, testing).
      - **Deliver (converge):** Select best solution, optimize, and implement.
  - **Key emphasis:** Spend enough time finding the *right problem* before solving it.
    - First diamond = problem finding.
    - Second diamond = problem solving.
## Persona
  - Persona is a **semi-fictional typical customer profile** built on **real data, research, and hypotheses**. It is not an imaginary character but an abstraction synthesized from interviews, observations, and behavioral data.
  - In **Customer Validation**, we test whether our product/service really solves the target customer’s pain points. Persona helps make customers concrete and actionable.
  - In this course, Persona is a **structured hypothesis of a customer**. Through interviews and validation, it gets refined to accurately represent your **early adopters**.
  - **Functions**
    - Helps the team understand **who the customer is** and **what their true pain points are**.
    - Aligns product, marketing, and sales with the same target user profile.
    - Avoids wasting resources “trying to serve everyone.”
  - **How to Define Persona in Customer Validation**
    - **Basic Info**
      - **Demographics**: age, gender, job, education, income, location.
      - **Lifestyle**: habits, hobbies, values.
      - Example: “25–35, startup product manager, based in Singapore, mid-to-high income, proficient with digital tools.”
    - **Goals & Motivations**
      - What goals do they want to achieve?
      - Why do they seek solutions?
      - Internal vs external drivers?
      - Example: “Wants to iterate products fast, reduce failure risk, show growth with data to investors.”
    - **Pain Points & Challenges**
      - What are their biggest obstacles now?
      - Why don’t current solutions work?
      - Example: “Lack of data-driven experiment framework, wastes resources on ineffective features.”
    - **Behavior Patterns**
      - How do they make decisions?
      - Where do they get info (social media, communities, word of mouth)?
      - What’s a typical day like?
      - Example: “Relies on LinkedIn & podcasts for tools, tries free versions before paying.”
    - **Buying Triggers**
      - What convinces them most (price, usability, peer rec, brand)?
      - Individual or team decision?
  - **Persona Example (simplified)**
    - **Name:** “Startup Sam”
    - **Profile:** 29-year-old product manager in a Singapore tech startup.
    - **Goals:** Launch successful product features with minimal waste.
    - **Pain Points:** Builds features without traction, lacks testing structure.
    - **Motivation:** Wants to prove competence to CEO & investors.
    - **Triggers:** Needs evidence-based methods, peer recs, trials.
  - **In Customer Validation**
    - Guide **interviews**: talk to the right people.
    - Validate **MVP fit**.
    - Check **early adopters match expected profile**.
  - **Persona Pain Points**
    - **Urgency** → High / Medium / Low
    - **Type** → Emotional / Functional
    - **Intensity** → High / Medium / Low

# Customer Validation
## What you must do (end-to-end loop)

  1. **Pick ONE persona (specific human)**

  * Must be reachable this week (in person or video).
  * Early adopter only: they’re **aware** of the problem and **attempting** to solve it.
  * Fill four quadrants: **Facts, Goals, Pains, Behaviors**.
  * Tag pains with **Urgency (H/M/L)** and **Intensity (H/M/L)**.

  2. **Write two hypotheses**

  * **Customer Hypothesis** = (Facts + Behaviors) → a single sentence.
  * **Problem Hypothesis** = (Pains + Goals) → a single sentence.
  * Use only stickies from your persona (add new ones only if you also add them back to the persona).

  3. **Make a Prediction Grid**

  * Decompose each hypothesis into **testable predictions** (one sticky per claim).
  * Force-rank each prediction on two axes:

    * **Importance** to the idea (impact if wrong).
    * **Confidence** (how sure you are right now).
  * The **bottom-right** item is your **Riskiest Prediction** (test this first).

  4. **Design the experiment (Customer Discovery Interview)**

  * **Goal**: validate/ invalidate the riskiest prediction with evidence from past behavior and concrete stories.
  * **Prep kit:**

    * Qualifying questions (to confirm “aware + attempting” fast).
    * Open, non-anchoring prompts (no pitching, no “ice-cream” questions).
    * Story prompts (“Tell me about the last time…”).
    * Intro script (earn trust), Outro script (ask for referrals).
  * **Rehearse**: 1 teammate plays the persona; others interview and timebox. You should deviate from the script in the real interview—script = practice, not teleprompter.

  5. **Run interviews (qualify fast)**

  * Find people **where they already are** (coffee shops, clinics, school gates, conferences, relevant online groups).
  * If they’re not your persona, **stop in 2–3 minutes** and move on.
  * Capture verbatim quotes + concrete episodes; avoid future-tense wishes.

  6. **Loop Analysis (one tool at a time, leftwards then right)**

  * Update **Prediction Grid** first (move the tested sticky up/down/remove).
  * If the prediction came from a hypothesis that’s now contradicted, **fix that hypothesis**.
  * Then update the **Persona** (remove or adjust the corresponding Facts/Goals/Pains/Behaviors).
  * Decide **Pivot vs Persevere**:

    * **Soft pivot**: adjust persona details; keep the core idea.
    * **Hard pivot**: throw it out and restart with a new persona/idea.
  * Pick the **next riskiest prediction** and repeat.
## Quantities & cadence (what “done” looks like)

  * **Minimum fieldwork this week**: aim for **20–25 interviews** to generate learning and pivots.
  * **Strong target** across the phase: \~**120 interviews** typically yield \~**10 fully validated loops** (N≠1).
  * **Exit Customer Validation** when you have **\~10 validated loops** (or you run out of time/budget) and a persona/hypotheses that survived red-triangle tests.
## Deliverables (what to put on your Miro/Canvas)

  1. **Persona board** (latest state)

     * Facts / Goals / Pains (with urgency & intensity) / Behaviors
     * A one-line early-adopter proof (“Aware + Attempting” evidence)

  2. **Hypotheses panel**

     * Customer Hypothesis (sentence)
     * Problem Hypothesis (sentence)

  3. **Prediction Grid**

     * Ranked predictions with the **Riskiest Prediction** highlighted
     * Timestamps of when each prediction was tested/updated

  4. **Experiment pack**

     * Qualifier + interview prompts (one slide)
     * Trust-earning intro & delightful outro
     * Bias traps you will avoid (anchoring, leading, yes/no)

  5. **Evidence log**

     * Short cards for each interview: who/where, persona-fit (Y/N), 1–3 quotes, verdict on the riskiest prediction (Validated/Invalidated/Inconclusive)
     * Photos/screens (if permitted), anonymized

  6. **Learning Loop slide**

     * “Before → Evidence → After” for each loop (what changed in Persona/Hypotheses/Predictions)
     * **Pivot tracker** (soft/hard) with rationale

  7. **Definition of Done slide**

     * Count of validated loops (toward \~10)
     * Residual red-triangle items (if any) and plan to resolve or proceed
## Roles (keep it tight)

  * **Interviewer (lead)**: runs the conversation, pulls stories.
  * **Note-taker**: timestamps, verbatim quotes, marks evidence.
  * **Observer/Coach**: watches for bias, calls time, suggests follow-ups.
  * Rotate roles each session.
## Quality bar (how you’ll be judged by reality)

  * You **found** true early adopters (behaviors prove “attempting,” not just “aware”).
  * You **tested** the real riskiest thing first (not the easy thing).
  * Your **changes** to persona/hypotheses were driven by **evidence** (quotes, episodes), not vibes.
  * You **pivoted** when evidence said so (and celebrated it).
  * Your final persona & hypotheses are **tighter** (less red in the grid).
## Quick starter checklist (today)

  * [ ] Lock one reachable early-adopter persona.
  * [ ] Draft the two hypotheses.
  * [ ] Build and rank the prediction grid; mark the riskiest.
  * [ ] Write qualifier + 6–8 open prompts (last-time stories).
  * [ ] Role-play once; fix the flow; assign locations to source personas.
  * [ ] Book 6–10 interviews per teammate over the next 3–4 days.
  * [ ] After each day, do a 20-minute loop analysis and update boards.
## Customer Validation Workflow
  Mirrors the **scientific method**:

  1. **Observation → Persona**
     Build a *specific, detailed persona* (facts, goals, pains, behaviors).

     > Not a segment, but one person you could actually interview.

  2. **Hypothesis → Customer & Problem Hypotheses**

     * **Customer Hypothesis = Facts + Behaviors**
       (e.g., *Jacelyn is a 25-year-old health enthusiast who waters down drinks to reduce sugar*).
     * **Problem Hypothesis = Pains + Goals**
       (e.g., *She wants <10g sugar/day but even the lowest product has 11g*).

  3. **Experiment → Customer Discovery Interviews**

     * Use role play to practice.
     * Then real interviews (coffee shop test, field observation, targeted outreach).
     * **Qualify fast**: make sure you’re talking to a *real* persona (early adopter, aware + attempting).

  4. **Analysis → Prediction Grid & Loop Analysis**

     * Break hypotheses into testable **predictions** (1 per sticky note).
     * Force-rank by:

       * **Impact if wrong** (low → high).
       * **Confidence** (low → high).
     * The **riskiest prediction** = high impact if wrong + low confidence.
     * Design & run experiments to test it.
## Specific Tasks (Week 4 Deck activity slide)
  As a team (30 min):

  1. **Specify where you’ll find customers** to interview.
  2. **Compose 10 interview questions** (to qualify fast, avoid pitching/anchoring/ice-cream Qs).
  3. **Define acceptance/rejection criteria** → what counts as hypothesis validated or invalidated.
  4. **Test the riskiest prediction first** (but note other learnings too).

  Then:

  * Do **role-play interviews** in class (coach plays the persona).
  * Capture **3 things that went well, 3 things to improve**.
  * Debrief: *what did we learn?*
## Key Lessons

  * **Qualify**: Don’t waste time on the wrong persona.
  * **Script**: Prepare questions, but don’t stick rigidly.
  * **Intro & Outro**: Build trust, end with a delightful experience.
  * **Avoid Yes/No & ice-cream questions**. Pull stories, not statements.
  * **Ask “And, what else?”** to uncover hidden pains/goals.
  * **N of 1 ≠ Proof**: Need multiple consistent validations.

  ✅ So your **customer validation deliverables** each week are:

  * A persona canvas (facts, goals, pains, behaviors).
  * Customer & problem hypotheses.
  * Predictions → riskiest prediction identified.
  * Designed & executed interviews (role play + real).
  * Loop back: refine persona/hypotheses with evidence, pivot if necessary.

# Lectures
## Week 2 lecture
  **[13:09]**
  So let’s do a high-level first. The idea of *Working Backwards*—this is a framework that was originally ideated at Amazon.

  **[14:06]**
  But there’s a downside to passion: you can actually have fights in your team, and we want to avoid that at all costs. So if you notice our process, what we did is—first, individually, everyone comes up with ideas.

  The rubric then takes the anger and the emotion into itself so you can’t be angry with other people in the group if your idea didn’t get chosen. If your idea didn’t get bubbled up, it’s because the rubric decided it, not your teammate.

  The only thing you can be mad at is the rubric. So we funnel emotional energy away from team members and towards the mechanism—the process. What you’ll see is that all of the tools we’re going to walk through are designed to remove emotion and politics, and place them in the mechanism, rather than forcing people to navigate them directly.

  We know innovation and creativity are emotional—we can’t and don’t want to change that. We want you to feel passion for the process. But recognize when those emotions are causing negative aspects, and use engineered processes to solve that.

  So that’s number two: the process removes emotion and drives decisions.

  **[14:08]**
  Now, a question to the class. You guys up there—your idea: did it evolve? Did it change through the group discussion?

  [Students respond: “Not really, we left it as it was.”]
  Cool. But notice, the story you told us was much longer than what you originally wrote down. The idea itself grew through team interaction.

  Another group: what about you guys? Did your idea evolve? [Students mention technical issues with their mirrors instead.]

  So what you’ll find with creative processes is that you never want to stop at the *first* good idea. You want to get to the *best* idea. But even then, it’s rare you’ll end up with the exact original concept. Usually, the team pushes and pulls the idea—adds aspects, grows it, pivots it. Through discussion, you end up with a much stronger idea.

  Innovation is rarely about solo geniuses. You may know Steve Jobs, but behind him were 100 innovators you don’t hear about. Innovation almost always comes from teams.

  **[14:10]**
  Our third rule of creativity: you need to be creative *in a team*. Especially in a work environment, you need that team.

  For a team to work, a few things are required. Firstly: **diversity**. Not demographic diversity for its own sake—men/women, regions, etc.—those are proxies. What you really want is **diversity of thought**.

  A team could look very diverse demographically, but if they all think the same, it’s not diverse at all. Conversely, you could have five 26-year-olds who think very differently—that’s true diversity.

  So be aware of proxies, but focus on *different thinking*.

  Secondly: **inclusion**. You need processes to ensure all those diverse voices are actually heard. That could mean rotating project managers, or switching who presents and who takes notes, so everyone has a role.

  **[14:13]**
  Notice the pattern we created: a **diamond** shape in creativity.

  1. First, generate as many ideas as possible—the divergent side of the diamond.
  2. Then, use a mechanism (like the rubric) to narrow down to one focus—the convergent side.

  That’s one diamond. Often, you’ll hear about the **Double Diamond**: you repeat this cycle again and again—divergence, convergence, divergence, convergence. Creativity is always moving through this cycle.

  **[14:19]**
  Now let’s get into the first mechanism of the *Working Backwards Toolkit*: **Customer Validation**.

  Remember, we have three mechanisms:

  * Customer validation
  * Solution validation
  * Business validation

  Customer validation comes first. Why? Because the most common innovation mistake is building something brilliant—but for nobody. An amazing business model without customers is still a failure. That’s why 85% of innovations fail.

  So first: **validate that the customer exists** and that they have a real pain point. If not, solutions, technology, disruption, even business models don’t matter.

  We tie this to the **scientific method**:

  * Observation → Persona
  * Hypothesis → Customer/problem hypothesis
  * Experiment → Customer discovery interviews
  * Analysis → Validation analysis

  **[14:23]**
  So the first tool: **Persona**.

  A persona is not a segment—it’s one *specific* person. They have a name, age, car brand, color, lifestyle. The detail matters.

  In marketing, personas are used to drive empathy and segmentation. In Working Backwards, personas are used to understand **product–market fit**. Very different purpose.

  By the end of today, each team must choose one customer persona with a real problem to solve.

  Choose someone you can actually meet this week—you’ll need to run interviews. Don’t choose a CTO in Sweden. For class purposes, it’s better if it’s someone accessible.

  Also: avoid picking yourself or close friends. That biases you.

  Use your “spider sense”: look for people who are unhappy, suffering, urgently seeking solutions. Don’t pick someone with a minor annoyance they don’t care about.

  **[14:28]**
  Remember Geoffrey Moore’s *Crossing the Chasm*. At this stage, we don’t care about the early majority or late majority—they’re wait-and-see people. We care about **early adopters**: people who *know* they have a problem and are *actively seeking* a solution.

  Example: the story of **Uber Cuts**.

  In the early 2000s, three guys in New York thought female sales reps would love an app to find a nearby salon before client meetings. They interviewed women—0% interested. Why? Because no professional woman would risk a haircut from a stranger before an important meeting.

  But by chance, they discovered men *were* interested. One woman said, “Not me, but my boyfriend needs a haircut.” They pivoted.

  Then, observing behavior in Times Square, they spotted early adopters: men checking their reflection in the Borders bookstore window. That told them these guys *knew* they had a problem and were seeking solutions. Targeting them gave rapid interview success.

  The moral: customer didn’t exist where they first thought. If they’d invested millions in the women’s market, it would have been a failure. Instead, identifying the *real* early adopter saved them.

  **[14:39–15:25]**
  Summary of **Persona guidelines**:

  * Be specific (one real person).
  * Must have an urgent, intense pain point.
  * Must be an early adopter (not a wait-and-see type).
  * Don’t use yourself or close friends.
  * For class: pick someone you can actually reach for interviews.

  Then: define **goals** for your persona. Not vague dreams (“I want to retire rich”), but actionable goals you can solve now (“I want to reduce my electricity bill by 20%”).

  Ask **why** repeatedly to uncover the deeper drivers. Example: a customer buying a mirror not for decoration, but for feng shui—to reflect the dragon. Understanding the true “why” lets you sell them much more.

  **[15:45–15:47]**
  Next, identify **pains**: capture urgency and intensity (high/medium/low). Note if pains are emotional, functional, or social. Also map *when and where* the customer experiences them. Pain isn’t constant—it spikes at certain moments (e.g. financial stress at bill-paying time). That’s when your solution must meet them.
## Week 3 lecture
  - **第一部分：13:02 – 13:07（first good idea & MVP）**。

    \[2025/8/26 13:02]
    And to do this, I think what we'll do is we should start up there, 'cause usually the people that don't like to ask questions sit in the back, right? So let's start.
    为了做到这一点，我觉得我们先从后排开始，因为通常不爱提问的人都坐在后面，对吧？所以我们从那边开始。

    \[2025/8/26 13:02]
    I'll disagree with the hypothesis — first question.
    我先来挑战一下这个假设——第一个问题。

    \[2025/8/26 13:03]
    OK, what's the question? What do we mean by the tyranny of the first good idea? Easy. Never believe in the tyranny of the first idea. Because when you engage in divergent thinking, you’ll have many different ideas.
    好的，问题是什么？什么叫做“第一个好主意的暴政”？其实很简单，不要相信第一个好主意的暴政。因为当你进行发散性思考时，会产生很多不同的想法。

    \[2025/8/26 13:03]
    People talk about different ideas, so we practice diversity, equity, and inclusion to get those ideas, and then converge to get a better idea for our MVP.
    大家会提出各种不同的想法，所以我们要通过多样性、公平和包容来收集这些想法，再进行收敛，从而得到一个更好的解决方案，最后形成我们的 MVP。

    \[2025/8/26 13:03]
    A couple of interesting points in that answer. What I would emphasize, though, is to think about the tyranny of the first good idea as a fixed action pattern. It's built into your brain. It tells you to stop ideating as soon as you hit the first good idea.
    你的回答里有几个有趣的点。但我要强调的是，要把“第一个好主意的暴政”看作一种固定行为模式。它实际上是内置在我们大脑里的，一旦你产生了一个看似不错的想法，大脑就会告诉你停止继续思考。

    \[2025/8/26 13:03]
    From our bricks activity, we know that the minute you come up with your first good idea, it’s rarely your best idea. So if you follow the tyranny of the first idea, you'll stop and never reach your best idea.
    从我们之前的“砖头活动”里你们已经体会到：当你产生第一个好主意时，那几乎从来不是你最好的主意。如果你屈服于“第一个好主意的暴政”，你就会停下来，永远到不了真正的最佳想法。

    \[2025/8/26 13:04]
    Right, you can’t stop this. All you can do is be aware when it’s happening to you, and then respond. Let’s pass the mic down.
    没错，你无法阻止这种心理机制。你能做的只是意识到它何时发生，然后采取行动应对。好，把话筒往下传。

    \[2025/8/26 13:04]
    OK… which one, right? Getting married? (laughter) OK. I wanted to highlight — you mentioned MVP. That’s the next question. Let’s go back to the pre-watch video. Everyone was supposed to watch it — it’s on the quiz. Define for me: what is an MVP?
    好的……哪一位？结婚的吗？（笑声）好，我要强调一点——你刚才提到了 MVP。这就是下一个问题。让我们回到课前视频。大家应该都看过，它会出现在测验里。请帮我定义一下：什么是 MVP？

    \[2025/8/26 13:04]
    The prototype of our idea, a minimum viable product. It’s to test customer reaction and our idea, so we can experiment and iterate. It’s the minimum version we can launch to market.
    MVP 是我们想法的原型，一个最小可行产品。它的目的是测试客户的反应以及我们的想法，这样我们可以进行实验和迭代。它是我们可以推向市场的最小版本。

    \[2025/8/26 13:05]
    Everybody understand that answer? That’s the wrong answer. Absolutely 100% wrong. You’ve all been brainwashed about what MVP means.
    大家听懂这个回答了吗？这是错的，完全错的。你们对 MVP 的理解都被“洗脑”了。

    \[2025/8/26 13:05]
    Eric Ries — the Lean Startup guy — was sad about this later, because he unfortunately coined the term wrong.
    Eric Ries（《精益创业》的作者）后来也对这件事感到遗憾，因为这个术语“不幸地”被误解了。

    \[2025/8/26 13:05]
    An MVP is just an experiment to test a hypothesis. That’s it. It doesn’t even need a physical prototype. Remember from the video: the Instagram founders went to Central Park with laptops and asked tourists, “Do you want us to Photoshop your photos so you can post them to Facebook?” No Instagram software. No filters. Nothing. Just humans using Photoshop.
    MVP 只是一个用来测试假设的实验，仅此而已。它甚至不需要物理原型。还记得视频里的例子吗？Instagram 的创始人带着笔记本去中央公园，问游客：“要不要我们帮你修一下照片，让你发到 Facebook 上？” 那时候根本没有 Instagram 软件，也没有滤镜，只有人工在用 Photoshop。

    \[2025/8/26 13:06]
    So don’t think of MVP as a thing. Think of it as experimentation. It starts way before you launch anything — it starts in customer validation.
    所以，不要把 MVP 当作一个“东西”。它其实是一种实验方法，甚至在你推出任何产品之前，在客户验证阶段就已经开始了。

    \[2025/8/26 13:06]
    The problem with the “minimum viable product” idea is it leads to boring products. If you launch something minimal, customers won’t be delighted. You’ll get branded as the boring company that ships boring products. That’s terrible advice for innovators.
    “最小可行产品”这种定义的问题在于，它导致无聊的产品。如果你推出的东西只是“够用”，客户不会感到惊喜，反而会觉得你这家公司只会做无聊的东西。这对创新者来说是极其糟糕的建议。

    \[2025/8/26 13:07]
    Go back to the original intention: MVP = experiment. If you are actually launching to customers, then use MLP — the Minimum Lovable Product. Only give customers something when you are sure it will delight them. Never launch just “viable.”
    回到最初的本意：MVP = 实验。如果你真的要把东西交到客户手里，那就应该叫 MLP——最小可爱产品。只有当你能确保客户会被打动、会喜欢时，才推出产品。永远不要仅仅为了“可行”而发布。
  - **第二部分（13:07–13:18，Customer Validation、Persona、Hypotheses）**

    \[2025/8/26 13:07]
    So after this class, stop using the term MVP. It’s misunderstood, and if you use it, you’ll be giving bad advice. Instead, just say “experiment” and “MLP.”
    所以，从这堂课之后，别再用 MVP 这个词了。它已经被误解了，如果你再用，就会给别人错误的建议。相反，请用“实验”和“MLP”。

    \[2025/8/26 13:07]
    And remember, we’re talking about early adopters here. In *Crossing the Chasm*, early adopters differ from early majority — you need different experiments for them.
    记住，我们这里谈的是早期采用者。在《跨越鸿沟》里，早期采用者和早期大众是不一样的，你需要针对他们设计不同的实验。

    \[2025/8/26 13:08]
    The MLP changes by segment. Customers are “evil” — you delight them today, tomorrow they’ll want more. Always more.
    MLP 会随着客户细分市场而改变。客户是“邪恶的”——你今天取悦了他们，明天他们就会要更多。永远不会满足。

    \[2025/8/26 13:08]
    Yes, innovation is a team sport. You’re allowed to pass the mic. Thank you.
    是的，创新是一项团队运动。你们可以把话筒传下去。谢谢。

    \[2025/8/26 13:09]
    Remember this answer: Observation → Hypothesis → Experiment → Analysis.
    记住这个流程：观察 → 假设 → 实验 → 分析。

    \[2025/8/26 13:09]
    What is the purpose of customer validation?
    客户验证的目的是什么？

    \[2025/8/26 13:09]
    The purpose of customer validation is to validate both the customer and the problem.
    客户验证的目的是验证客户是否存在，以及他们是否真的有我们认为的那个问题。

    \[2025/8/26 13:10]
    We describe who we’re talking about with facts, then goals, then pains that stop those goals, then the behaviors customers use to relieve pains. That’s the persona’s story flow.
    我们通过事实来描述客户是谁，然后是他们的目标，再是阻碍目标的痛点，最后是他们为缓解痛点而采取的行为。这就是用户画像（persona）的故事线。

    \[2025/8/26 13:10]
    What are the three categories of goals and pains?
    目标和痛点分成哪三类？

    \[2025/8/26 13:10]
    Social, emotional, and functional.
    社会性的、情感性的和功能性的。

    \[2025/8/26 13:10]
    How do you know you’ve found an early adopter?
    你怎么知道你找到了早期采用者？

    \[2025/8/26 13:10]
    Two things: remember the table with early adopters, early majority, late majority. Early adopters are aware and actively attempting solutions. Early majority are aware but not attempting — they wait to see what happens.
    两个标准：还记得早期采用者、早期大众和晚期大众的表格吗？早期采用者既有意识到问题，也在积极尝试解决方案；早期大众有意识到问题，但不会尝试，他们会等别人先做。

    \[2025/8/26 13:11]
    So early majority are pragmatists — they want evidence-based solutions. Early adopters are visionaries.
    所以早期大众是实用主义者——他们想要基于证据的解决方案；早期采用者是愿景型的人。

    \[2025/8/26 13:12]
    Next question: what is the importance of urgency and intensity?
    下一个问题：紧迫性和强度的重要性是什么？

    \[2025/8/26 13:12]
    Urgency is how soon the customer needs the problem solved. Intensity is how strongly they feel the pain. Together, they determine whether this is worth solving.
    紧迫性是指客户需要多快解决问题；强度是指客户对痛点的感受有多强烈。这两个因素一起决定了问题是否值得解决。

    \[2025/8/26 13:14]
    The first tool in customer validation is the persona. It helps us ask: does the customer exist, and do they really have the problem?
    客户验证的第一个工具是 persona（用户画像）。它帮助我们回答：客户是否存在？他们是否真的有这个问题？

    \[2025/8/26 13:14]
    From persona, we generate two hypotheses: a customer hypothesis and a problem hypothesis. “Customer” = who they are. “Problem” = do they have the problem we think they have.
    基于 persona，我们生成两个假设：客户假设和问题假设。客户假设 = 他们是谁；问题假设 = 他们是否真的有我们认为的那个问题。

    \[2025/8/26 13:15]
    Customer hypothesis = facts + behaviors. Use only post-its from those quadrants. Problem hypothesis = pains + goals. Use post-its from those quadrants.
    客户假设 = 事实 + 行为。只能用 persona 上相应象限的便利贴。问题假设 = 痛点 + 目标。也只能用对应象限的便利贴。

    \[2025/8/26 13:17]
    Example: Janice, 25, health enthusiast (facts). She waters down her drinks to reduce sugar (behavior). That’s a customer hypothesis.
    例如：Janice，25 岁，健康爱好者（事实）。她会把饮料兑水来减少糖分（行为）。这就是一个客户假设。

    \[2025/8/26 13:18]
    Problem hypothesis example: goal = reduce sugar intake to 10g/day; pain = lowest-sugar juice still has 11g/serving. Combine them into a sentence.
    问题假设示例：目标 = 将糖摄入量降到每天 10 克；痛点 = 市场上最低糖分的果汁仍然有 11 克/份。把它们组合成一句话，就是问题假设。
  - **第三部分（13:18 – 13:26，生成与筛选假设、团队讨论流程）**

    \[2025/8/26 13:18]
    Your task now is to create one customer hypothesis and one problem hypothesis. Don’t jump to solutions first. Any questions?
    你们现在的任务是：先各自写出一个客户假设和一个问题假设。不要急着想解决方案。有什么问题吗？

    \[2025/8/26 13:19]
    When you combine facts and behaviors, do you just put them together, or do you debate which ones matter more?
    当你把事实和行为组合起来时，是直接拼在一起，还是要讨论哪些更重要？

    \[2025/8/26 13:19]
    Good question. I’ll give you 12 minutes. The best way: each team member independently proposes what they think is the best hypothesis. Then you regroup, discuss, argue, and converge to one. That way you get diversity at the start, then convergence at the end.
    这是个好问题。我给你们 12 分钟。最好的方法是：每个队员先独立写出他们认为最好的假设，然后再集合起来讨论、争论，最后收敛到一个。这样一开始有多样性，最后有收敛。

    \[2025/8/26 13:19]
    All that matters is: end with one customer hypothesis and one problem hypothesis. Your Miro board already has the canvas. Any other questions?
    关键是最后必须有一个客户假设和一个问题假设。你们的 Miro 看板已经准备好画布了。还有其他问题吗？

    \[2025/8/26 13:19]
    Alright, 12 minutes.
    好，12 分钟，开始。

    \[2025/8/26 14:06]
    So let’s talk about confidence. We often *feel* confident just because we’ve gathered smart people for a few days. But that false confidence leads to product failure. I feel it too, as a builder.
    现在我们来谈谈“信心”。我们常常会觉得很有信心，只因为我们聚集了一群聪明人开了几天会。但这种虚假的信心往往导致产品失败。作为建设者，我自己也有这种感觉。

    \[2025/8/26 14:06]
    Let the process save you from the 85% failure rate. Step back and remember: nothing is validated yet. No evidence. You should have zero confidence until you gather evidence through experiments.
    要让流程把你从 85% 的失败率里解救出来。退一步想：目前什么都没被验证过，没有任何证据。在你通过实验收集到证据之前，你应该有零信心。

    \[2025/8/26 14:07]
    Right now everything is HIPPOs — Highest Paid Person’s Opinion. The boss writes an idea on a napkin at the bar, Monday morning tells you to build it, you spend 9 months and \$20M, and then discover the customer doesn’t exist or the problem isn’t real. That’s how 85% of products fail.
    此时的一切都只是 HIPPO ——“最高薪人的意见”。老板周末在酒吧餐巾纸上写了个想法，周一叫你们去做，你们花了 9 个月和 2000 万美元，最后才发现客户根本不存在，或者问题根本不是真的。这就是 85% 的产品失败的原因。

    \[2025/8/26 14:08]
    Don’t feel bad if you said 70% or 100% confidence earlier. I hard-coded that slide because I knew you’d say that — thousands of workshops show the average is \~75%. It’s normal to feel that.
    别觉得不好意思，你们刚才说 70% 或 100% 信心的时候，我其实早就预料到了。我在幻灯片里专门写了这一点，因为几千场工作坊的平均值就是大约 75%。这种感觉很正常。

    \[2025/8/26 14:08]
    But it’s bad. Like sugar — natural to crave, but harmful. So recognize the feeling when it happens, and trust the process, not yourself.
    但它是有害的，就像糖一样——人类天生会渴望，但它有害。所以当你感受到这种虚假信心时，要立刻意识到，并且相信流程，而不是相信自己。

    \[2025/8/26 14:09]
    Let’s take an 11-minute break. Be back by 14:20.
    我们休息 11 分钟，14:20 回来。
  - **第四部分（14:23 – 14:41，Predictions Grid & Riskiest Prediction）**

    \[2025/8/26 14:23]
    Example: Janice, 25, a health enthusiast, waters down her drinks to reduce sugar. She wants to reduce sugar intake, but there’s no product that does that. That was our original customer + problem hypothesis.
    例子：Janice，25 岁，健康爱好者，她会把饮料兑水以减少糖分。她想要降低糖分摄入，但市面上没有满足这一需求的产品。这就是我们最初的客户 + 问题假设。

    \[2025/8/26 14:23]
    So what are the predictions? Her name is Janice — that’s a prediction. She’s 25 — prediction. She’s a health enthusiast — prediction. She waters down drinks — prediction. She wants to reduce sugar — prediction.
    那么，这里面有哪些预测呢？她叫 Janice —— 这是一个预测。她 25 岁 —— 一个预测。她是健康爱好者 —— 一个预测。她会兑水 —— 一个预测。她想要降低糖分摄入 —— 还是一个预测。

    \[2025/8/26 14:23]
    Each element in the hypothesis is an individual prediction we need to test. Customer hypothesis = facts + behaviors. Problem hypothesis = pains + goals. From these, we derive predictions.
    假设中的每个元素其实都是需要测试的预测。客户假设 = 事实 + 行为。问题假设 = 痛点 + 目标。我们从这里面提炼出预测。

    \[2025/8/26 14:24]
    Sometimes there are implied predictions too — things you didn’t explicitly write but actually believe to be true.
    有时还会有隐含的预测——你没有明确写出来，但心里其实认为是真的。

    \[2025/8/26 14:41]
    If a prediction turns out false and it’s serious — e.g., the whole problem doesn’t exist — then the entire idea collapses. You must start over.
    如果某个预测被证明是假的，而且很严重——比如整个问题根本不存在——那么整个想法都要推翻，必须重新开始。

    \[2025/8/26 14:41]
    But if the difference is minor — e.g., you thought the customer was 48 but she’s 47 — we can live with that. It’s still a change, but not fatal.
    但如果只是小差异——比如你以为客户 48 岁，结果她其实是 47 岁——这种差异是可以接受的。虽然要调整，但不至于致命。

    \[2025/8/26 14:41]
    Now I want you to force-rank your predictions in a single-file line at the bottom of the prediction grid. No ties allowed. This helps us identify which predictions are most critical.
    现在我希望你们把预测按照优先级排成一条直线，放在预测网格的底部。不能有并列。这能帮助我们识别哪些预测最关键。
  - **第五部分（15:01 – 15:10，Working Backwards、失败率、Riskiest Prediction 循环）**
    \[2025/8/26 15:01 – 15:10]

    \[2025/8/26 15:01]
    Working Backwards is the reality. Many times you’ll have to move forward even without full confidence. That’s OK — running even one experiment is better than none.
    反向工作法（Working Backwards）反映的就是现实。很多时候你必须在没有完全信心的情况下继续推进。这没关系——哪怕只做一次实验，也比不做要好。

    \[2025/8/26 15:01]
    The goal isn’t to go from 85% failure to 0%. The best companies we’ve seen (like P\&G) still have \~65% failure. Petronas about the same. You’ll never get perfection.
    目标不是把 85% 的失败率降到 0%。我们见过最好的公司（比如宝洁）也还有大约 65% 的失败率。Petronas 也差不多。永远不可能做到完美。

    \[2025/8/26 15:02]
    But going from 90% failure (1 in 10 successes) to 60% failure (4 in 10 successes) — that has a huge business impact. Perfection isn’t needed; better is enough.
    但是，把失败率从 90%（10 个里成功 1 个）降到 60%（10 个里成功 4 个），这对业务已经是巨大的改变。我们不需要完美，只需要变得更好。

    \[2025/8/26 15:02]
    In the Prediction Grid: red triangle = must test. Blue line = test if you can. Yellow triangle = forget it.
    在预测网格里：红色三角 = 必须测试。蓝色横线 = 有条件测试。黄色三角 = 可以忽略。

    \[2025/8/26 15:03]
    Of all predictions, one matters most: the riskiest prediction. It’s the one with biggest impact if wrong, and lowest confidence. It’s usually bottom-right of the grid. That’s the one you must test first.
    在所有预测中，最重要的是“最具风险的预测”。它一旦错了影响最大，同时也是我们最没信心的。通常在网格的右下角。你必须优先测试它。

    \[2025/8/26 15:06]
    Now, two rules for the validation loop. Rule #1: you must move left until every tool to the left is “clean” (up to date and consistent). Only then move right again.
    现在，验证循环有两条规则。规则一：你必须先往左走，直到左边的所有工具都是“干净的”（最新且一致）。只有这样，才能再往右走。

    \[2025/8/26 15:06]
    Rule #2: you may only move one box at a time. From Experiment you can only go to Prediction Grid, not jump back to Hypotheses directly.
    规则二：每次只能移动一个格子。从“实验”只能回到“预测网格”，不能直接跳回“假设”。

    \[2025/8/26 15:07]
    So, if you’re in Experiment and validate a fact, you go left to the Prediction Grid, move that prediction up. Not yet building solutions — we still have more predictions to test.
    所以，如果你在“实验”环节验证了一个事实，你要往左回到“预测网格”，把那个预测上移。但别急着进入解决方案阶段，因为还有很多预测要验证。

    \[2025/8/26 15:09]
    If the result supports the hypothesis, leave hypotheses and persona unchanged — they stay “clean.” Then pick a new riskiest prediction, and go test it.
    如果结果支持了假设，那就不用改动假设和用户画像，它们保持“干净”。然后选一个新的最具风险的预测，再去测试。

    \[2025/8/26 15:10]
    That’s the loop: Prediction Grid → Experiment → back to Grid → maybe Hypotheses → Persona if needed. Always one step at a time.
    这就是循环：预测网格 → 实验 → 回到网格 → 如果需要则修正假设 → 再更新用户画像。始终一次只走一步。
  - **第六部分（15:14 – 15:26，实验失败 → 假设/Persona更新 → 时间与资源限制）**
  \[2025/8/26 15:14 – 15:26]

  \[2025/8/26 15:14]
  Now, suppose the experiment shows a prediction is false. What do we do? Rule #1 says: move left until all tools are clean.
  现在假设实验表明某个预测是错误的。我们该怎么办？根据规则一：继续往左走，直到所有工具都是干净的。

  \[2025/8/26 15:15]
  Where did that prediction come from? From a hypothesis. If the prediction was about a pain point, then it came from the problem hypothesis.
  这个预测来自哪里？来自假设。如果预测是关于某个痛点的，那它就来自问题假设。

  \[2025/8/26 15:15]
  So we don’t touch the customer hypothesis, because we have no new data about facts or behaviors. But we must adjust the problem hypothesis — because part of it is now false.
  所以我们不会动客户假设，因为我们还没有新的事实或行为数据。但我们必须调整问题假设，因为其中一部分已经被证明是假的。

  \[2025/8/26 15:16]
  Next, keep moving left to the persona. Persona reflects everything we currently believe is true. If a pain is invalid, remove it. Log the change.
  接下来继续往左走，回到用户画像。用户画像反映的是我们目前认为正确的所有信息。如果一个痛点被否定，就要删掉它，并记录下这一变化。

  \[2025/8/26 15:17]
  But pains are linked to goals. If a pain is invalid, maybe the related goal is also suspect. As a team, discuss whether that goal should also be removed.
  但痛点和目标是相互关联的。如果一个痛点被否定，相关的目标也可能值得怀疑。团队需要讨论是否也要删掉这个目标。

  \[2025/8/26 15:18]
  And goals connect to behaviors. So again, you discuss: do we still believe those behaviors make sense? If not, remove them too.
  而目标又与行为相关。所以你们要再次讨论：这些行为是否仍然合理？如果不合理，也要一并移除。

  \[2025/8/26 15:19]
  So, in summary: experiment → prediction invalidated → update prediction grid → update problem hypothesis → update persona (pain, goal, maybe behavior). Step by step, always left first.
  总结一下：实验 → 预测被否定 → 更新预测网格 → 更新问题假设 → 更新用户画像（痛点、目标、可能还有行为）。一步步来，总是先往左走。

  \[2025/8/26 15:24]
  Now, reality check: your boss will never give you enough time. The best you can do is protect the red triangle. Try to validate the riskiest predictions. But sometimes you’ll run out of time and money and must move on.
  现在来点现实提醒：老板永远不会给你足够的时间。你能做的最好努力是保护好“红色三角”。尽量去验证最具风险的预测。但有时你会耗尽时间和预算，不得不继续往下走。

  \[2025/8/26 15:24]
  Ideally, you want 10 validated experiments before moving on to solution validation. But to get 10, you may need to run \~120 experiment cycles, because many loops will only partially succeed.
  理想情况下，你需要在进入解决方案验证前完成 10 个完全验证的实验。但为了得到这 10 个，你可能需要跑大约 120 个实验循环，因为很多循环只能部分成功。

  \[2025/8/26 15:25]
  With a team of 6, you can split into 3 pairs running in parallel, so that reduces the load. In practice, most teams can finish customer validation this way.
  如果你有 6 人团队，可以拆成 3 对并行运行，这样能大幅减轻工作量。实践中，大多数团队都能用这种方式完成客户验证。

  \[2025/8/26 15:26]
  That’s the Working Backwards philosophy: lots of red at the start (0% confidence), gradually less red as you test. If your boss says stop early, that’s reality — but at least you know what you do and don’t know.
  这就是反向工作法的理念：一开始全是红色（0% 信心），随着验证逐渐减少。如果老板提前喊停，那就是现实——但至少你清楚哪些你已经知道，哪些你还不知道。

  \[2025/8/26 15:26]
  Excellent job. Round of applause.
  非常棒，给自己鼓掌。👏

  - **\[2025/9/2 13:12 – 13:17]  工具定位：假设、预测网格与优先级**
    \[2025/9/2 13:12]
    We could. What the riskiest prediction really tells you is: what to test first. It’s not a business prioritization tool; think of it as an experiment prioritization tool for very specific tests.
    可以的。所谓“最具风险的预测”真正告诉你的，是**先测试什么**。它不是商业优先级工具，而是**实验优先级**工具，用来选择**具体先测哪一项**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:12]
    Hypotheses are where you’re forced to make business decisions. Remember your persona has many sticky notes—facts, pains, goals, behaviors. Which ones do we build into a hypothesis? That’s on you.
    **假设**是你被迫做商业取舍的地方。Persona 上贴了很多便签（事实/痛点/目标/行为），**哪些要纳入假设**，需要你们自己做决定。

    \[2025/9/2 13:13]
    The tool helps, but you must do the work: as a team, prioritize what matters in the persona, then use the prediction grid to create testable statements.
    工具会帮忙，但工作还是要你们做：团队先**在 persona 层面排优先级**，再用**预测网格**把它们变成可测试的陈述。

    \[2025/9/2 13:13]
    Isn’t the hypothesis the first point of prioritization—so you know which persona matters most? Yes. Hypotheses are the first prioritization (“what matters”), then the prediction grid is tactical (“what to test first”).
    “假设是不是第一层优先级，因此能判断哪个 persona 最重要？”是的。**假设=第一层优先级（什么重要）**，**预测网格=战术层（先测什么）**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:13]
    Fair point—this slide’s a bit confusing. Award yourself +1 imaginary point. Pass the mic.
    说得对——这页确实容易混淆。给自己\*\*+1 虚拟积分\*\*。把话筒传下去。

    \[2025/9/2 13:13]
    How do we know it’s an early adopter?
    我们如何判断对方是**早期采用者**？

    \[2025/9/2 13:13]
    One: they have the pain. Two: the pain feels urgent.
    第一：他们**确有痛点**。第二：痛点具有**紧迫性**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:14]
    A group eager to try your product also fits.
    愿意**主动尝试**你方案的群体，也符合特征。

    \[2025/9/2 13:14]
    Close—you’re using the framework but slightly out of order. Anyone else?
    接近了，你在用框架，但顺序有点乱。还有其他说法吗？

    \[2025/9/2 13:14]
    They’re out there, trying to solve the problem. Early majority is aware but not trying yet—waiting to see.
    早期采用者**已经在尝试解决问题**。而**早期大众**只是**知道问题**但**还在观望**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:14]
    From the perfect quiz memory: “aware + attempting.” That’s what to remember about early adopters.
    还记得小测里那句\*\*“aware + attempting”\*\*吗？这就是早期采用者的要点。

    \[2025/9/2 13:15]
    New question: in the persona, which quadrant tells us whether this is an early adopter?
    新问题：在 persona 里，**哪个象限**能判断是不是早期采用者？

    \[2025/9/2 13:15]
    Behaviors. If you struggle to put a credible behavior sticky, it’s probably not an early adopter—by definition they’re attempting to solve the problem.
    **行为象限**。如果你很难贴出可信的“行为”，那多半**不是**早期采用者——因为他们的定义就是**正在尝试**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:15]
    Which prediction should you test first?
    那应该先测试哪条预测？

    \[2025/9/2 13:15]
    The riskiest one.
    **最具风险**的那条。

    \[2025/9/2 13:16]
    Yes—then move it back across the loop.
    对——验证后把它**按规则回填**到循环里。

    \[2025/9/2 13:17]
    From the Experiment tool, what do I do next?
    从**实验**这个工具往回走，我下一步做什么？
  - **\[2025/9/2 13:28 – 13:37]  Pivot（转向）与坚持**
    \[2025/9/2 13:28]
    We need to change our approach. There are two kinds of pivots: soft and hard.
    我们需要改变方法。转向（Pivot）有两类：**软转向**和**硬转向**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:29]
    Soft pivot: you change the persona (or parts of it) but keep the fundamental idea. You were off on a pain or a fact—so you tweak it.
    **软转向**：**调整 persona/其要素**，但**保留核心想法**。比如你在某个痛点或事实上偏了，就微调。

    \[2025/9/2 13:29]
    Hard pivot: experiments show something fundamental is wrong. You clear the board and start from scratch.
    **硬转向**：实验显示**根本性错误**。**清空重来**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:30]
    Statistically, with six teams, about four should hard-pivot twice this semester. That’s normal.
    按统计，在 6 个队里，约**4 个队**在本学期会**进行两次硬转向**——很正常。

    \[2025/9/2 13:30]
    Four teams will realize the persona they imagined weeks ago doesn’t exist—the pains/facts were wrong. In Working Backwards, we celebrate pivots.
    会有 4 个队认清几周前想的 persona **并不存在**——痛点/事实都错了。**在 Working Backwards 里，我们庆祝转向**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:31]
    Pivoting early saves you months and millions. Better to learn in a week than after six months and a million dollars.
    **越早转向越省时间和钱**。一周学到比半年后花了一大笔再发现错误好太多。

    \[2025/9/2 13:31]
    Politically, bring evidence back to your boss. “Your idea is great, we researched it for a week; here’s the evidence showing why it doesn’t work.”
    在组织沟通上，要**带着证据**回去汇报：“点子很棒，我们研究了一周；但证据显示这样不可行。”

    \[2025/9/2 13:32]
    That’s how you convince leaders—evidence, not opinions.
    用**证据**而不是意见，才能说服管理者。

    \[2025/9/2 13:32]
    Did anyone pivot last week? Good. Be mentally ready to pivot.
    上周有人转向了吗？很好。**要在心态上随时准备转向**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:33]
    If you never throw work away, you’re likely just carrying forward old assumptions. Statistically, it’s impossible you nailed a great persona two weeks ago.
    如果你从不丢弃工作，说明你**在搬运旧假设**。按统计，两周前就把 persona 想得很准，**几乎不可能**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:34]
    So, celebrate pivots—soft and hard. Hard pivots get +10 imaginary points. Next week we’ll share learning journeys from experiments.
    因此要**庆祝转向**（软/硬皆是）。硬转向\*\*+10 虚拟分\*\*。下周展示你们的实验学习旅程。

    \[2025/9/2 13:34]
    I put a file in your Canvas: “Understanding Pivoting.” Read it now—after the question.
    我在 Canvas 放了“**Understanding Pivoting**”。先听完问题，再读。

    \[2025/9/2 13:35]
    Hard pivot means completely different direction. In real life, you can get a new persona quickly—use generative AI to help, but don’t be afraid to start a fresh chat/thread.
    **硬转向=完全换方向**。现实中**很快能起新 persona**。生成式 AI 可帮忙，但要敢于**新开对话、清空上下文**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:37]
    We balance pivoting with perseverance. Sometimes you should run more experiments if execution was poor.
    转向要和**坚持**平衡。有时如果实验执行不佳，应该**再试几次**。
  - **\[2025/9/2 13:38 – 14:01]  访谈最佳实践（Lift 视频 & The Mom Test）**
    \[2025/9/2 13:38]
    Take 6 minutes to read the handout “Understanding Pivoting.” Then we’ll watch a short video from Lift on customer interviews.
    先花 6 分钟读讲义“Understanding Pivoting”。之后看 Lift 的客户访谈短视频。

    \[2025/9/2 13:54]
    Welcome to the Lift series on customer development: how to do good customer interviews and the rules around them.
    欢迎来到 Lift 的客户开发系列：**如何做好的客户访谈及其规则**。

    \[2025/9/2 13:55]
    Rule 1: No pitching. If they think you’re selling, they won’t open up.
    **规则1：不要推销**。一旦对方觉得你在卖东西，就不会敞开说实话。

    \[2025/9/2 13:55]
    Rule 2: No ice-cream questions (e.g., “Do you want ice cream?”). Everyone says “yes,” and you learn nothing.
    **规则2：别问“冰淇淋问题”**（“要不要冰淇淋？”）。大家都会说要，没信息量。

    \[2025/9/2 13:56]
    Rule 3: Pull, don’t push. Ask open questions and let them surface real problems.
    **规则3：拉信息，不要推想法**。用开放式问题，让对方自己说出真实问题。

    \[2025/9/2 13:57]
    Rule 4: N of 1 ≠ proof. One person’s answer never validates or invalidates a hypothesis.
    **规则4：一个样本不构成证据**。一个人的说法不够。

    \[2025/9/2 13:58]
    Rule 5: Past behavior predicts future behavior. Ask about the last time, not ideals.
    **规则5：过去行为是未来行为的最佳预测**。问“上一次怎么做”，而不是理想状态。

    \[2025/9/2 14:00]
    Rule 6: Stories > statements. Stories give depth and follow-up angles.
    **规则6：故事胜过笼统陈述**。故事信息密度高，便于追问。

    \[2025/9/2 14:01]
    They have more videos on YouTube. Next: read Chapter 1 of *The Mom Test*. If you can, buy it—it’s worth it.
    他们在 YouTube 上还有更多视频。接下来读 *The Mom Test* 第一章。如果可以买，**强烈建议购买**，物超所值。
  - **\[2025/9/2 14:46 – 14:57]  课堂角色扮演与“快速资格判断”**

    \[2025/9/2 14:46]
    Let’s do interviews now.
    现在开始**访谈演练**。

    \[2025/9/2 14:50]
    (Team runs a mock interview about healthcare convenience vs. cost; interviewee answers that public hospital service is subsidized and routine, so no real pain.)
    （团队进行**医疗便利 vs 成本**的模拟访谈；受访者表示公立医院补贴+流程固定，**没有痛点**。）

    \[2025/9/2 14:55]
    Pause. Volunteers were instructed to **lie**—they’re **not** your persona. The point: we waste a lot of time interviewing the wrong people. **Qualify fast**.
    暂停。志愿者是按要求**扮演非 persona**。要点：你们经常把时间**浪费在不合格对象上**。所以要**快速资格判断**。

    \[2025/9/2 14:56]
    If they’re not the persona, the interview doesn’t count—stop early. Now they’ll come back as “real” personas; try again.
    如果对方不是 persona，**这次访谈不算数**——尽早止损。现在他们会以“真实 persona”再来一轮。

    \[2025/9/2 14:57]
    Round 2—reset your board and try again.
    进入第二轮——**重置**看板，重新开始。
  - **\[2025/9/2 15:32 – 15:45]  量表/锚定、信任与样本数**

    \[2025/9/2 15:32]
    If the persona is anxious, can we ask “on a scale of 1–10, how anxious are you?”
    如果我们关心“焦虑”，能直接问“1–10 分你多焦虑”吗？

    \[2025/9/2 15:33]
    Risky. You’re **anchoring** them—you’ve told them what you care about. Better: infer anxiety via **behaviors + stories** (“Tell me about a time… What did you do?”).
    风险很大。你在**锚定**对方（暴露你的关切）。更好做法：用**行为+故事**来**侧证**焦虑（“讲讲上次…你做了什么？”）。

    \[2025/9/2 15:34]
    If they **spontaneously** mention “anxiety,” that’s strong validation.
    如果他们**自发**提到“焦虑”，那就是强验证。

    \[2025/9/2 15:43]
    N of 1 ≠ proof. I’d like to see 4–5 real personas **all** invalidating before I pivot; exact number depends on confidence and budget.
    **一个样本不算证据**。若要转向，我倾向于看到**4–5 位真实 persona 都给出一致的否定**；具体数量看信心与预算。

    \[2025/9/2 15:44]
    Surveys don’t qualify here (they anchor and can’t ask “why”). Later, in solution validation, surveys are fine.
    **问卷在此阶段不合适**（容易锚定、无法追问“为什么”）。**解决方案验证阶段**再用问卷更合适。

    \[2025/9/2 15:46]
    Write a script, then **don’t** read it verbatim with real people. The script earns you the right to **improvise**.
    要写脚本，但**真实访谈别照本宣科**。脚本的意义在于让你**能即兴**。

    \[2025/9/2 15:48]
    Ella Fitzgerald: “One night of jazz improv follows a thousand nights of scales.” Michelle Obama: the magic on stage is hard work off stage.
    Ella Fitzgerald：**一晚的爵士即兴，来自一千晚的练习**。Michelle Obama：台上“魔法”，源自台下**苦功**。

    \[2025/9/2 15:49]
    Intro = earn trust; Outro = leave them delighted. Early adopters want you to succeed—treat interviews like a **brand experience**.
    开场要**赢得信任**；结尾要**让对方愉悦**。早期采用者希望你成功——把访谈当作一次**品牌体验**。

    \[2025/9/2 15:50]
    You’ll make mistakes—catch yourself, acknowledge, move on.
    你会犯错——**察觉—承认—继续**。

    \[2025/9/2 15:51]
    Close by asking: “What did I not ask that I should have?” and “Do you know others like you I could talk to?” Early adopters know other early adopters—get **referrals**.
    结尾可问：“我**还漏问**了什么？”以及“你是否**可以引荐**类似情况的人？”早期采用者认识其他早期采用者——争取**转介绍**。
  - **\[2025/9/2 15:53 – 16:05]  四大工具闭环 & 自底向上细分**

    \[2025/9/2 15:53]
    We’ve now covered all four tools: Persona → Hypotheses → Prediction Grid → Experiments—loop until budget runs out or you reach \~10 fully validated interviews, then move to Solution Validation.
    四个工具全覆盖：**Persona → 假设 → 预测网格 → 实验**。循环往复，直到**预算用尽**或达到**约 10 个完全验证的访谈**，再进入**解决方案验证**。

    \[2025/9/2 15:54]
    It took 4 weeks in class, but in real life you’ll do this in days once you practice.
    课堂用了 4 周；实战**熟练后几天就能跑完**。

    \[2025/9/2 15:55]
    This scientific method works beyond products—use it to find truth in any domain (even family life).
    这套**科学方法**不限于产品；**任何需要寻真**的场景都适用（甚至在家庭关系中）。

    \[2025/9/2 15:56]
    How do we break out of the loop? Budget exhaustion or \~120 interviews yielding \~10 full validations—statistically that’s what you’ll see.
    如何“跳出”循环？要么**预算用完**，要么**约 120 次访谈**得到**约 10 次完全验证**——统计上多会如此。

    \[2025/9/2 15:56]
    So far I insisted on a single persona. But businesses must sell to segments. Traditional top-down segmentation (e.g., “males 18–35 in big SEA cities”) is crude.
    至今我们强调**单一 persona**。但做生意要面向**细分市场**。传统自上而下（如“18–35 岁东南亚一线城市男性”）**太粗糙**。

    \[2025/9/2 15:58]
    Working Backwards uses **bottom-up segmentation**: start with a validated persona’s pains/goals, then **change one fact at a time** (age, gender, income), keeping pains/goals constant, and **re-test**.
    Working Backwards 做**自底向上细分**：基于已验证 persona 的**痛点/目标**，**每次只改一个事实**（年龄/性别/收入），**保持痛点与目标不变**，再去**复测**。

    \[2025/9/2 16:00]
    This yields a segment where 100% of people truly share the same pains/goals—every marketing dollar hits real customers.
    这样得到的细分里，**100% 的人共享同样痛点/目标**——营销**精准**。

    \[2025/9/2 16:01]
    Example: Females 48–57 may have the “elderly parents’ appointment management” pain; high-income may not (they hire full-time help). That’s how you carve the segment.
    例：**48–57 岁女性**可能共有“年迈父母就医管理”的痛点；**高收入**群体可能没有（有专人护理）。由此**切分**市场。

    \[2025/9/2 16:02]
    Use your class network—45 people trained in the same tools. Practice everywhere: taxis, cafés, observations—there’s no cost to practice.
    利用你们的**同班网络**（45 人掌握同一套工具）。**随处练习**：出租车、咖啡馆、观察法——**零成本**。

    \[2025/9/2 16:04]
    Next week I’ll be away; your instructors will lead. Document your **learning loop** on your Miro board and present.
    下周我不在，由老师带课。请在 Miro 上**记录学习循环**并做展示。

    \[2025/9/2 16:05]
    After next week, clean your tools, execute pivots, and do a second round of discovery before solution validation. Aim for 20–25 interviews first; real validations often start around \~40.
    下周后整理工具、执行转向，并在进入解决方案验证前做**第二轮探索**。先**目标 20–25 次访谈**；**真正的验证**常在**约 40 次**后出现。

    \[2025/9/2 16:06]
    When possible, with permission, take photos (anonymize names) and add them to the canvas—pictures tell a story.
    如条件允许、经许可，可**拍照**并**匿名**上传到画布——**图片能讲故事**。

    \[2025/9/2 16:07]
    If you hit 10 in a week—great. But typically you need 20–25 to finish pivoting; otherwise, you don’t have enough data to claim learning.
    一周做到 10 个当然好，但通常需要**20–25 次**才能把该转的转完。不然**数据不足**，很难称之为“学到”。

    \[2025/9/2 16:08]
    If everything validates easily, your interview is probably bad or biased—truth rarely comes that easy.
    如果**所有**访谈都“顺利验证”，多半是**访谈做坏了/有偏差**；真相很少如此轻松。

    \[2025/9/2 16:08]
    That’s it for today. Thank you!
    今天到这里，谢谢大家！
  - **\[2025/9/2 16:14 – 16:15]  课后问答片段**

    \[2025/9/2 16:14]
    Interviews—what exactly counts as “learning”? Are pivots the key outcome?
    关于访谈，“学习”的判据是什么？**转向**是否是关键产出？

    \[2025/9/2 16:15]
    A single question can yield multiple insights. “Learning” means evidence that **validates or invalidates** your riskiest predictions—and whether that triggers **pivot** or **persevere**.
    一个问题可以产出多条洞见。“学习”的含义是：对**最具风险预测**的**验证/证伪**证据，以及这是否触发**转向**或**继续坚持**。
## Week 6
  [2025/9/16 13:02] Yeah.
  [2025/9/16 13:02] Yeah.
  [2025/9/16 13:02] They went to a good—
  [2025/9/16 13:02] No, no, no.

  [2025/9/16 13:11] If you “validate” too quickly, you probably didn’t challenge yourselves enough. Statistically that’s what happens. It’s not a judgment on you; it’s just likely at this stage.

  [2025/9/16 13:11] This round you should have had one or two hard pivots. Most of you won’t; you’ll still be doing soft pivots for a few more weeks. If you didn’t pivot, no problem, but take the warning: you may be steering interviews to get the answers you want. That’s usually why teams only show soft pivots at this stage.

  [2025/9/16 13:12] So, let’s see if you changed your customer hypothesis—the facts, behaviors, and goals.
  [2025/9/16 13:12] Remember: customer hypotheses are facts and behaviors (with goals), not just goals.
  [2025/9/16 13:12] I think you need a question… OK.
  [2025/9/16 13:12] So you changed both the customer and the problem?

  [2025/9/16 13:13] Did you change the persona drastically? Is it a completely different person? The age band might still be mid-40s, but does that persona still have the same pains and goals you originally thought, or have you moved significantly?

  [2025/9/16 13:13] Speaking of pop quizzes… you volunteered for the hardest question. Are you ready?
  [2025/9/16 13:13] Just kidding—no pop quiz this week. From last week’s three teams, it sounds like you’ve got the basics. Keep tweaking.

  [2025/9/16 13:13] Quick checklist to keep in mind: customer facts, behaviors, pains and goals; problem hypotheses; and so on—make sure you can answer all of those. We’ll come back to them in graded components.

  [2025/9/16 13:14] Questions for me? Anything still confusing that needs clarification?

  [2025/9/16 13:14] Q: If we don’t have a “hell yes” on the customer hypothesis, can we move on?
  [2025/9/16 13:14] A: It’s more of a “heck yeah” than a “hell yes.” At this stage, yes—because we’re about to move into solution validation. You should have done enough interviews to feel you’ve found something true and can proceed. There will still be holes; you’ll continue validating the customer during solution validation. But to move on, you need strong confidence that you’ve found a real customer with a real pain.

  [2025/9/16 13:15] Q: How specific should the problem be—narrow vs. broad?
  [2025/9/16 13:15] A: In class, narrower is better because specificity improves empathy. In reality, you’d also be running the “valuable” filter from business validation (i.e., is the segment large enough for a business?). We haven’t taught business validation yet, so in class lean specific to deepen empathy.

  [2025/9/16 13:16] Some of you started discussing “new features.” That’s not where we are—we’re still validating goals and pains.
  [2025/9/16 13:16] Q: We’re unsure how to validate a goal—example?
  [2025/9/16 13:17] A: What you described sounds like features. We’re not at features yet. During customer validation you must be disciplined: as builders we want to jump to solutions, but that’s the mistake that leads to the 85% failure rate. For now: no features, no product talk. Focus on: does this customer exist, and do they truly have this problem?

  [2025/9/16 13:17] Up through this week you shouldn’t have been thinking about cartoons, gamification, or any solution ideas. If you did, you skipped steps. You haven’t validated the customer/problem yet.

  [2025/9/16 13:18] Also, don’t call them “users” yet—that implies a solution. Think of them as people with pains and goals. If they suggest features in interviews, say: “Great idea—thank you. Let’s go back to your goals and pains.” Judo-redirect them away from solutions and back to validation.

  [2025/9/16 13:19] As a team, help each other resist the builder impulse. The toolkit is trying to slow you down enough to really validate customer and problem. If interviewees push you toward solutioning, park those ideas for later and get back to validation. Starting today we’ll open solution validation—but up to now you should have pushed solutions aside.

  [2025/9/16 13:20] Before we go on—quick story. When I was in LA, a friend had a fun AI idea. You know how ChatGPT and other generative AIs pick up your tone and mirror it? What if you trained the tone on someone else—say, a celebrity—by feeding audio/video of them, so your assistant talks like that star?

  [2025/9/16 13:21] Some platforms already have “personality GPTs”—think “Wednesday Addams” style, where the tone is dry and snarky. You could upload any personality instead of choosing a preset. Character.AI does similar things.

  [2025/9/16 13:22] But the first question for any idea is always: who is the customer, and what problem do they have? Do people actually want to download a star’s personality for their chatbot? We don’t know until we understand the customer and their problem.

  [2025/9/16 13:23] That was a trick question. In Working Backwards we don’t start with solution pitches; we start with customer and problem. When someone pitches you a cool idea—friend, founder, cousin—say: “Let’s not focus on the idea yet. Who’s the customer? What pains do they have?” If they can’t clear that hurdle, stop there.

  [2025/9/16 13:24] So: no more starting at solutions. Stop. Customer first, problem second. If those are convincing, then we talk solutions.

  [2025/9/16 13:24] You’ve finished the customer validation loop and have the tools. You’ve had two weeks to practice. Now we move to solution validation.

  [2025/9/16 13:24] Customer validation asks: does the customer exist and do they have the problem? Solution validation asks: can we delight that customer? Not just “viable,” but “lovable.”

  [2025/9/16 13:25] Like customer validation, solution validation mirrors the scientific method: observation, hypothesis, experiment, analysis. The four tools are: Problem Canvas (observation), Solution Hypothesis (hypothesis), Pitching & Actualization experiments, and Solution Validation Loop Analysis. Once you grok customer validation, these feel natural—they mirror the same science flow.

  [2025/9/16 13:26] Today we’ll cover the first two tools—starting with the Problem Canvas.

  [2025/9/16 13:26] To build the Problem Canvas, go back to your persona’s pains. By now you should have 3–5 validated pains. If you haven’t fully completed interviews, for class we’ll assume they’re validated—but in the real world you can’t move on until they are.

  [2025/9/16 13:27] On the Problem Canvas you copy those pains and sort them on two axes. X-axis: Impact—if we solve this pain, how delighted is the customer? Far right = they’re thrilled. Far left = “meh.”

  [2025/9/16 13:28] Y-axis: Will—do we want to solve this, and are we capable of solving it? It mixes desire and capability. Thyroid cancer might be huge impact, but unless you have medical chops your Will is low—so it sits low on Y. Make sense?

  [2025/9/16 13:29] Copy all pains onto the canvas and sort by Impact and Will. It’s constrained by your team’s capabilities, though you can raise Will if you’re prepared to hire missing expertise.

  [2025/9/16 13:29] Any questions? OK—10 minutes in Miro: copy the pains; don’t move the original persona notes.

  [2025/9/16 13:41] If a pain is high Impact but low Will, consider partnering with a company that has the skills. You still want customer delight; a partner can help deliver it.

  [2025/9/16 13:41] For low-Impact/high-Will items: should we build them? Only if they’re truly quick and easy—and be careful. Engineers often underestimate effort, and extra features increase cognitive load. Too many “nice-to-haves” dilute lovability. Treat them as backlog for later, after the Minimum Lovable Product.

  [2025/9/16 13:44] High-Impact/high-Will items are your “build now.” If your canvas shows many top-right pains, you still choose which 2–4 to focus on.

  [2025/9/16 13:45] If your canvas mostly lands in low-Impact or low-Will, that’s a signal: you didn’t do customer validation deeply enough. You should have filtered out pains you don’t want to solve or that won’t delight. Ideally you end with 2–4 pains in the top right.

  [2025/9/16 13:46] Yes, sorting feels subjective when you haven’t done enough interviews. With more interviews, it becomes evidence-based. Time is our classroom constraint.

  [2025/9/16 13:47] “Addictiveness” or engagement is more of a business validation concern. In solution validation we want urgent, intense pains; addictiveness helps business validation later, not this step.

  [2025/9/16 13:48] The process is taught linearly, but reality is messy and iterative. If you have a strong business-validation reason to keep a pain that’s not top-right, you can make that call. You’re allowed to bend rules when you understand why.

  [2025/9/16 13:49] Outcome: select 2–4 top-right pains to solve. You’re not yet deciding how to solve them—no AI, no CV, no specific features—just which pains to target.

  [2025/9/16 13:50] Next tool: the Solution Hypothesis (sometimes shown alongside the Problem Canvas). Most fields reuse info from customer validation:

  * Line 1 (Goal): copy the relevant goals that your selected pains map to.
  * Measure of Delight: copy the customer’s own words you captured under each goal.
  * Pains: copy the red (top-right) pains from the Problem Canvas.

  [2025/9/16 13:51] New field: Success Metric. Translate “measure of delight” into a quantitative metric you can prove. This is for the team, not the customer.

  [2025/9/16 13:51] Behaviors: copy the associated behaviors from persona.
  Current happiness level: how effective those current behaviors are (as a group).
  What happens if we don’t solve it: add this new field—describe the negative consequence if there’s no solution.

  [2025/9/16 13:52] When/Where: reuse the triggers (when/where/how often) from your pains. So the only truly new bits are Success Metric and “What happens if we don’t solve it.” Take 15 minutes to fill it in. Questions?

  [2025/9/16 14:08] Reminder: “Painter” (the pains quadrant) is just a helper to get to the Problem Canvas. That’s a pop-quiz-type distinction.

  [2025/9/16 14:08] We still haven’t talked solutions. In Working Backwards we delay solutioning as long as possible. The risk is jumping early and building the wrong thing for the right reasons.

  [2025/9/16 14:09] Now—in the Solution Hypothesis—you’re *finally* allowed to talk solutions. Treat this as a special moment: you’ve gathered enough evidence that a real customer with a real problem exists.

  [2025/9/16 14:09] The Problem Canvas describes the customer’s problem. The Solution Hypothesis asks: what’s the best way to delight them on those chosen pains?

  [2025/9/16 14:10] First step in solution validation: research what already exists. Early adopters Google solutions. Become your persona and search like they would. Spend five minutes individually finding existing attempts.

  [2025/9/16 14:15] (Activity instructions for folding paper omitted here; we’ll just focus on concept flow.)

  [2025/9/16 14:47] About the criss-cross layout: eventually you’ll have a Customer Hypothesis on one side and a Problem/Solution side on the other; the order matters so it folds cleanly. The sequence is: facts → goals → pains → behaviors.

  [2025/9/16 14:48] Remember the Bricks game? First ideate individually, then agree on a rubric. Same here: each of you generates solutions first; then, as a team, you need a **rubric** to choose the best. In solution validation, that rubric is called **Solution Tenets**.

  [2025/9/16 14:49] Tenets are the checklist you’ll use to grade solutions from your brainstorming. We’ll look at real examples. Important: **tenets are not features**, and they’re customer-oriented (not “easy for us,” “scalable for us,” unless your boss mandates it). Write your own tenets, then discuss your Crazy-8 sketches as a team, and select one concept to take forward.
## Week 7 0930
  * [13:02–13:03] **Customer validation refresher**
    Our aim in customer validation is to verify that our target customer truly exists, has the pains we think they have, and cares enough for us to solve them. We use a loop of tools to do this, mirroring the scientific method.

    我们做「客户验证」的核心，是确认：这个目标客户确实存在、确实有我们假设的痛点、而且足够在意，值得我们去解决。方法是用一套循环工具，对应科学方法四步。

  * [13:03–13:06] **Transition to solution validation & its four tools**
    Solution validation checks more than “does it work”; it asks “does it delight?” We again mirror the scientific method with four tools: Problem Canvas (observation), Solution Hypothesis (hypothesis), Pitching & Actualization (experiment), and Solution Validation Loop Analysis (analysis). Use “delight” as your quality bar.  

    进入「方案验证」时，不仅要验证“能不能解决”，更要追求“能否让用户惊喜”。四个工具分别对应科学方法：问题画布（观察）、解决方案假设（假设）、试投与实作（实验）、方案验证循环分析（分析）。把“让人喜欢/惊喜（delight）”当作目标线。

  * [13:06–13:08] **Pain Sorter quadrants (what to do with each corner)**
    When you sort pains by “customer value if solved” (Impact) and “do we want to solve this,” act accordingly: bottom-left = throw out; bottom-right = partner; top-left = save for later; top-right = build now. These guide what migrates into your Problem Canvas.   

    把痛点按两个轴排序——“解决后的客户价值（Impact）”与“我们是否想做”。对应操作：左下角丢弃；右下角找伙伴；左上角以后再说；右上角现在就做。被选中的痛点再迁移进问题画布。  

  * [13:08–13:14] **Interview rules (carry-over from customer validation)**
    Avoid “ice-cream questions” (everyone will say yes), ask for “stories not statements,” remember “n of 1 is not proof,” and rely on “past behavior predicts future behavior.” These keep you honest while testing resonance.    

    访谈要点：不要问“冰淇淋式问题”（人人都会说好）；要“故事而非口号”；“一个样本不构成证据”；“过去行为是未来行为更好的预示”。这些能保证你在检验“是否共鸣”时更客观。   

  * [13:14–13:15] **Solution Tenets (stepping-stone to the hypothesis)**
    Tenets are the team’s customer-oriented requirements that narrow Crazy-8 ideas to one direction and later guide the build. They’re not features and not internal wishes; they’re the rubric to choose and to keep you honest.

    解决方案信条（Tenets）是以客户为中心的“准则”，用于从 Crazy-8 的一堆点子里收敛到一个方向，并在后续开发中持续校准。注意：它不是功能清单，也不是“我们内部想要什么”。

  * [13:15–13:21] **Measure of Delight vs Success Metric**
    On the Problem Canvas, “Measure of Delight” is how the customer themselves would describe success in their own words; the “Success Metric” is how we quantify urgency/intensity and effectiveness so we can measure it. Customer-voice for delight; team-metric for measurement.

    在问题画布里，“喜悦度量（Measure of Delight）”是用客户自己的话描述“成功是什么样”；“成功指标（Success Metric）”是我们用来量化紧迫度/强度与效果的数字化标准。前者讲客户感受，后者便于我们衡量。

  * [13:21–13:22] **Full solution-validation loop recap**
    Solution validation = Problem Canvas → Solution Hypothesis → Pitching & Actualization (experiment) → Loop Analysis. Same backbone as the scientific method.

    方案验证= 问题画布 → 解决方案假设 → 试投与实作（实验）→ 循环分析。完全对应科学方法四步。

  * [13:22–13:29] **Reading the Amazon Bank 1-pager (pitch artifact)**
    The PR is a structured “future press release” used to test resonance: hand it to validated customers and observe whether they lean in or glaze over—this is a pitch experiment input.  

    新闻稿（PR）是结构化的“未来发布稿”，用于测共鸣：交给已验证的客户，看他们是“被吸引”还是“无感”。这是试投实验的关键材料。

  * [13:30–13:33] **Two layers of experimentation**
    Pitching is free(ish): we “show our work” and see if the solution idea resonates. If it does, we earn the right to spend a little to run Actualization, where the persona must leave actually delighted—the problem truly solved—while we keep time and cost near zero.

    实验分两层：试投（几乎零成本）→ 展示我们的方案，看是否“有感觉”；若通过，再进入实作（Actualization）→ 真的把问题解决、让对方带着“被打动”的体验离开，同时尽量把时间和成本压到接近 0。

  * [13:33–13:36] **What counts as a Pitching experiment**
    Classic pitch: share your PR, Journey Map, Customer Canvas, Problem Framer with validated customers; field questions and test resonance. A “hand-raise” style signal is fine as long as it’s from the right persona.

    典型试投：把 PR、用户旅程、客户画像画布、问题框架给已验证的客户看；记录问题与反应，判断是否“有共鸣”。衡量方式可以简单，但要确保是“对的人”的反应。

  * [13:35–13:37] **Three forms of Actualization**
    Choose the lightest way to actually deliver delight: Judo (借力现成资源验证)、Concierge（人工、不可扩展地完成价值）、Wizard of Oz（前端像真产品，后端人工/拼接实现）。Pick the cheapest path that still proves the core.

    实作有三类：柔道式（Judo，借助已有平台/资源去试）、礼宾式（Concierge，人工完成服务验证价值）、绿野仙踪（Wizard of Oz，前端“像真产品”，后端人工或临时拼接）。原则：最省事但能证明核心的那条路。

  * [13:37–13:40] **Breaking out of the loop**
    You can exit solution validation when: the customer’s problem was actually solved; they’d go away delighted; and you’ve kept time and cost close to zero. Then proceed to business validation.

    满足这三条就可以跳出循环：问题真解决了；客户确实“被打动”；投入的时间与成本接近 0。然后进入「商业验证」。

  * [13:38–13:39] **Write your PR with step-by-step ChatGPT prompts**
    We’ll draft your team’s press release now. In the Canvas folder (same place as “Amazon Bank PR”), there’s a set of ChatGPT prompts that build the PR paragraph by paragraph. You must insert the yellow-highlighted parts (your customer description and your problem hypothesis). Each time the document says “Prompt,” paste that line into ChatGPT as a new turn and continue the same conversation thread so context carries through. Generate a first draft, read it critically against your business so far, edit, and then upload your revised version back to the shared file.

    现在开始写你们团队的新闻稿（PR）。Canvas 里有一套按段落引导的 ChatGPT 提示（和 “Amazon Bank PR” 在同一路径）。把黄色高亮处（客户描述、问题假设）补进去。文档里每出现一次 “Prompt”，就把那行作为新一轮对话发给 ChatGPT，并且一直用同一个对话串以保持上下文。先出首稿，再对照你们目前的业务理解做修改，最后把修改版回传到共享文件。

  * [14:09–14:11] **Keep one ChatGPT thread updated as your “teammate”**
    Don’t outsource thinking to the model. Use one persistent ChatGPT conversation across the semester so it “remembers” your evolving project. Whenever you pivot or refine artifacts after customer discovery, update that same thread; otherwise, when you ask it for a PR later, it will be out of date. Keep tools tidy: once you’re happy with a near-final PR, also paste it into your Mural/Canvas so grading can reference it.

    不要把思考全交给模型。整个学期尽量用同一个 ChatGPT 对话，把项目的变更持续同步进去；否则它会“落后”，写不出最新的 PR。保持工具整洁：PR 有较稳定版本后，也要放进 Mural/Canvas，方便后续评审。

  * [14:11–14:12] **How to run the Pitching experiment with your PR**
    Take this PR back to the customers you interviewed during customer validation. Show it and watch: if they look unmoved, loop back—re-run pain prioritization, Crazy-8s, and early tools. If they light up and ask “When can I try/pay?”, that’s a pass—you’ve validated the design in your Solution Hypothesis and can proceed.

    拿着 PR 回到之前访谈过的目标客户面前。观察反应：如果无感，回环——重做痛点优先级、Crazy-8 和前置工具；如果眼睛一亮、问“什么时候能用/我可以付钱吗？”，就算通过——说明你的解决方案假设被验证，可以继续推进。

  * [14:12–14:14] **Actualization overview: three ways to “actually delight”**
    Next is Actualization: you must truly solve the customer’s problem and leave them delighted, with minimal spend. Three common modes: (1) Judo—borrow someone else’s infrastructure to deliver value without building your own; (2) Concierge—manually deliver the service in the open, customers know it’s manual; (3) Wizard of Oz—front end looks real, back end is manual, customers don’t know.

    接着是“实作”验证：要真解决问题、让客户带着“被打动”的体验离开，同时尽量少花钱。常见三法：（1）Judo 借力法：借用别人的基础设施先交付价值；（2）Concierge 礼宾法：人工实现，客户知道是人工；（3）Wizard of Oz 绿野仙踪法：前端像真产品，后端人工拼接，客户不知情。

  * [14:19–14:21] **Judo examples: IKEA pilot shelves; Airbnb × Craigslist**
    Judo case 1：创业者先在 IKEA“借位”测试柜，验证顾客是否买单，后来 IKEA 甚至官方开放给初创测试。Judo case 2：Airbnb 早期把房源一键分发到 Craigslist 获得免费流量和注册，直到被对方封堵。启示：去用户已经聚集的平台“借力”，先把人带回你的产品。

    Judo 案例 1：在 IKEA 借助现成客流验证需求，之后成为官方试点渠道。案例 2：Airbnb 早期通过 Craigslist 导流，迅速起量。要点：到现有平台“找人、引流、带回”。

  * [14:21–14:22] **Concierge clarified (Instagram’s Central Park test)**
    Instagram 在写代码前，拿着电脑在中央公园帮游客“美化照片”，当场返还，游客满意即可。客户知道你是手工做，但他的痛被真实解决，这就达到“实作”的最低要求。

    Instagram 在真正开发前先做线下人工服务，客户清楚是人工，但问题被解决，这就算“让客户高兴而离开”。

  * [14:22–14:25] **Wizard of Oz: Zappos, Aardvark, CardMunch**
    Zappos 早期：网站看似齐全，实际下单后创始人去线下店拍照、买鞋、邮寄。Aardvark：看似智能匹配，后台是实习生人工路由。CardMunch：名片识别“很准”，幕后是 Mechanical Turk。要点：最小化你构建的部分，把“可行”交给客户来判定。

    绿野仙踪思路：前端给“像真”的体验，后台用人工/外包完成。核心：你决定“最小”，客户决定“可行”。

  * [14:26–14:27] **MVP is an experiment, not a launch**
    Actualization 仍是“实验”，不是正式发布。可以是原型，但目标是验证能否让客户真正高兴地离开，而不是堆功能。

    MVP 在这里的定义是“验证性实验”，不是上线产品；评判标准是客户问题被解决、体验真实可感。

  * [14:27–14:27] **Design good experiments or you learn nothing**
    和客户验证一样，实作前要精心设计：推演流程、做脚本与演练，即使现场不逐字照念，脚本也能帮你准备。当实验设计糟糕，再多执行也产不出有效结论。

    实验设计决定产出质量：先“演练—脚本—走查”，确保每一步都能收集到判断所需的信号。

  * [14:47–15:24] **Crazy-8: design 8 ways to actualize**
    回到 Crazy-8：把纸分成 8 个方格，独立思考并画出 8 种“实作验证”的方案（Judo/Concierge/Wizard of Oz 的不同变体都行），先各自出图，不要交流，之后再收敛成团队方案。

    Crazy-8 要求每人独立想出 8 种“如何做实作验证”的路线，先发散再聚合。

  * [15:24–15:26] **Exit criteria & keep costs low**
    实作阶段的评判：把方案交到客户手上后，问题是否真的被解决？他们是否足够满意以致愿意推荐/付费？同时尽量把成本与时间压到最低。很多经典案例主要花的是“时间成本”，几乎不花钱。

    通过标准：真解决、真高兴、真低成本/快验证。

  * [15:26–15:27] **Investor gut-check before Business Validation**
    团队自检：如果你们每人要掏 2k–10k 真金白银继续做“商业验证”，此刻你们愿不愿意投？若犹豫，说明证据还不够或方向需微调/转向；若坚定，说明已积累到可继续投入的信心。

    用“是否愿意自投”的方式检视证据强度——这比口头表态更诚实。

  * [15:27–15:28] **Wrap-up: from Customer → Solution → Business validation**
    回顾：客户验证=客户是否存在且确有痛点；方案验证=我们能否真正让客户高兴地离开（四个工具给出证据）；接下来是“商业验证”=能否设计出可赚钱的商业模式与其变体，并据此推进。

    下一步将进入商业验证工具箱：围绕商业模式设计与验证，评估这项机会能否“跑得通、赚得到”。
## Week 8 1007
  * [13:10–13:11] **Week 8 roadmap: Business Validation**
    We will build two FAQ canvases, then synthesize them into a Business Hypothesis, run Business Evaluation experiments, and close the loop with analysis. This sequence is the Business Validation cycle.
    我们会先完成两份 FAQ 画布，然后把它们整合成《商业假设》，接着开展商业评估实验，最后进行复盘分析。这一整套就是“商业验证”循环。
  * [13:11–13:12] **Two FAQs: external vs internal**
    There are two FAQs to compile. External FAQ = questions from customers, channel partners, and press. Internal FAQ = questions from internal stakeholders using the 7V model.
    需要编两份 FAQ。对外 FAQ＝来自客户、分销伙伴和媒体的问题；对内 FAQ＝面向内部利益相关者，按“7V”模型组织的问题。
  * [13:12–13:14] **External FAQ: the five sections**
    Most buyer questions fall into five sections: WIIFM (value to me), Usage, Price, Support, and Safety. Use these as your baseline; add more if your space needs it.
    对外 FAQ 通常涵盖五类：对我有什么好处（WIIFM）、如何使用、价格、支持、安全。以此为基础，若你的领域有特殊问题，可补充新类别。
  * [13:14–13:16] **External FAQ: default question bank + homework**
    Use the slide question bank to pre-write answers: WIIFM items (claims, time-to-benefit, scope), Usage (features, availability, onboarding), Price, Support, Safety. Homework: pick 5–10 questions per section and draft baseline answers.  
    利用课件中的题库提前写好答案：WIIFM（产品主张、见效时间、边界）、使用（功能、上市时间、上手方式）、价格、支持、安全。作业：每个部分选 5–10 个问题，产出首版答案。
  * [13:17–13:21] **Value proposition: from “valued” to “valid”**
    A strong value proposition starts with being valued: solving urgent and intense pains customers will pay for; and valid: your features map one-to-one to pains and actually work. Maintain a clear pain↔feature map.  
    价值主张首先要“值得”（valued）：解决客户紧迫且强烈的痛点，客户愿意付费；同时要“有效”（valid）：功能与痛点一一对应且起作用。务必保持清晰的“痛点↔功能”映射。
  * [13:22–13:26] **Competition and “Valunique”**
    Expect competition. Its presence is evidence of real value in the market. Your task is to be “Valunique”: hold a sustainable, defensible advantage and compete on the right differentiation vectors.
    要预期竞争；竞争本身说明市场里确有价值。你的任务是做到“独特可值”（Valunique）：形成可持续、可防守的优势，并在正确的差异化维度上竞争。
  * [13:27–13:28] **Value chain: delivery matters**
    Even great products fail without delivery. Secure the whole chain from inputs to manufacturing, logistics, distribution, sales, and after-sales so you can scale.
    再好的产品若交付不了也会失败。要把从投入、生产、物流、分销、销售到售后的整条价值链打通，才能扩张。
  * [13:28–13:30] **Seven “V” lens for the Internal FAQ**
    Use the 7V lens when drafting the internal FAQ: Valued, Valuable, Valid, Valunique, Value Chain, plus the remaining V-areas culminating in valuation and investor return. The internal FAQ proves you understand how to run a business.  
    编写对内 FAQ 时采用 7V 视角：Valued、Valuable、Valid、Valunique、Value Chain，以及与估值和投资回报相关的其余 V 领域。对内 FAQ 的目标是向利益相关者证明你理解如何运营一门生意。
  * [13:31–13:33] **Internal Evidence and Business Plan**
    In *Working Backwards*, a business plan equals internal evidence. It answers every stakeholder question across the 7V framework. A solid PRFAQ example from an oil company in Malaysia once secured USD 150 million. It shows how a well-structured internal FAQ can meet Fortune 500 decision standards.
    在“反向工作法”中，商业计划就是内部证据。它要逐一回答七个 V 框架中的所有利益相关者问题。讲者展示的马来西亚某石油企业 PRFAQ 范例曾成功获得 1.5 亿美元投资，说明一份结构完整的内部 FAQ 能达到 Fortune 500 级的决策标准。

  * [13:33–13:35] **Sweat Equity and Negotiation**
    Founders often overvalue sweat equity, but investors buy only the asset’s *current* value, not past effort. Cash-flow math (NPV or IRR) determines valuation. Emotional leverage can adjust price slightly, but labor history has no numerical worth.
    创业者常高估“辛劳股权”，但投资者只看当前资产价值，不计过去努力。估值以现金流（净现值或 IRR）为准。情绪诉求可成为谈判筹码，但工作投入本身没有数学价值。

  * [13:36–13:37] **Investor as Customer**
    Think of investors as customers whose “pain” is the need for returns. Your business plan must tell a story ending in *profit*, not in innovation, process, or ideals. Profit = Revenue – Cost. That’s the narrative they buy.
    把投资者当成客户，他们的“痛点”是需要回报。商业计划要讲一个“以盈利结尾”的故事，而非炫技或理想。利润 = 收入 – 成本，这才是他们真正购买的叙事。

  * [13:38–13:40] **Implementability, Sustainability, and Exit**
    Investors test three proofs: implementability (you can execute), sustainability (you can defend profit over time), and exit (they can withdraw capital). A “zombie” company—growing but never exiting—is worst for investors.
    投资者看三项证据：可执行性（你能落实计划）、可持续性（利润可长期防守）、可退出性（他们能收回资金）。所谓“僵尸公司”——增长却无退出——是投资者最厌恶的类型。

  * [13:41–13:47] **Cost Formula: People, Production, Promotion, Place**
    Startup cost ≈ People + Production + Promotion + Place. People = Headcount × Salary. Minimize through lean teams, outsourcing, automation, or tech efficiency while keeping brand-defined quality.
    创业成本 ≈ 人力 + 生产 + 推广 + 渠道。人力成本 = 人数 × 薪资。用精简团队、外包、自动化或技术提升来降低成本，同时维持品牌要求的最低质量线。

  * [13:48–13:50] **Five-Year People Plan**
    Build a five-year headcount plan—who to hire, when, and why. Headcount assumptions define your real strategy because they constrain execution capacity.
    制定五年人力规划：何时、为何、聘谁。人员配置假设本身就限定了执行能力，因此等于真实战略。

  * [13:51–13:57] **Revenue Story: From Creative Labs to Apple**
    *Creative’s* Zen Jukebox proved “first-mover disadvantage.” Innovators love products; Apple loved revenue systems. Around one innovation, Apple built an ecosystem—iTunes, App Store, accessories—capturing the *halo* revenue. Entrepreneurs must map **all** possible revenue streams, not only the core product.
    *Creative* 的 Zen Jukebox 印证了“先行者劣势”。创新者热爱产品，苹果热爱收入体系。苹果在单一创新周围打造 iTunes、App Store、配件等“光环”收入。创业者要规划**所有**潜在营收来源，而非仅限核心产品。

  * [13:58–14:00] **Pricing Basics**
    Maximum price = customer-perceived value. Minimum = cost to produce. Competition drives prices down; firms counter by adding differentiation and brand value.
    最高价格 = 客户感知价值；最低 = 生产成本。竞争会压价，企业需靠差异化与品牌溢价来抵抗。

  * [14:03–14:05] **Perception and Cost Levers**
    You *can* charge above perceived value—by changing perception through marketing and branding. You *can* charge below current cost—by lowering real unit cost via operational efficiency. Pricing sits between these moving boundaries.
    价格可高于感知价值——靠营销塑造认知；也可低于现有成本——靠运营效率降本。定价始终在这两个动态边界之间。

  * [14:07–14:12] **Volume and Segmentation**
    Volume depends on segmentation. Since you can’t serve everyone, focus on defined groups—demographic, psychographic, geographic, behavioral. *Working Backwards* adds persona-based segmentation validated by experiments.
    销量取决于细分。无法服务所有人，要锁定特定群体：人口特征、心理特征、地域或行为。反向法强调以人物画像为中心，并用实验验证细分。

  * [14:14–14:21] **Beachhead and Bowling-Pin Strategy**
    “Beachhead” = first target segment where you concentrate all effort to ensure victory (Normandy analogy). Once secured, expand to adjacent “bowling pin” segments that leverage existing strengths. One beachhead + two pins suffice for a five-year plan.
    “滩头阵地”即首个目标细分市场，要集中火力确保赢得突破（诺曼底登陆比喻）。占稳后向相邻“保龄球瓶”市场扩展，借力现有优势。五年规划中，一滩头 + 两瓶足够。

  * [14:23–14:25] **Market Sizing and Share**
    Use public data or paid reports (Gartner, EIU, Forrester). NUS Library gives free access. Define each segment’s size × target share to compute volume.
    可用公共数据或付费报告（Gartner、EIU、Forrester）获取市场规模。NUS 图书馆免费可查。计算各细分市场规模 × 目标份额即可得销量。

  * [14:26–14:31] **Target Share: 20–35 Percent**
    Aim for 20–35 % share. Below 20 % → too weak to defend; above 35 % → unrealistic without monopoly power. Pick smaller ponds where you can be a big fish.
    目标市占率设在 20–35 %。低于 20 % 太弱难自保，高于 35 % 不现实。应选“小池塘做大鱼”。

  * [14:33–14:34] **Business Plan Focus**
    Investors care about the profit formula, not the story of product development. Technical and team details belong in the appendix. A plan that starts with customer profit needs, not founder pride, sells better.
    投资者关心利润公式，不在乎开发故事。技术与团队细节放附录。以客户盈利需求为起点的计划，更能打动人。

  * [14:34–14:43] **Barriers to Entry: Beyond IP**
    Strong defense ≠ patents alone. IP is weak without resources to enforce. Better barriers include supply-chain control, exclusive distribution, regulatory influence, economies of scale, and network effects locking users or influencers.
    有效防御不等于专利。没钱维权的 IP 很脆弱。更强的壁垒包括供应链控制、独家渠道、监管关系、规模经济、网络效应及关键意见领袖的锁定。

  * [14:43–14:47] **Distribution Lock-In Example**
    Colgate contracts force retailers to stock non-profitable SKUs to occupy shelf real estate, blocking competitors. Controlling shelf space is a legal, powerful entry barrier.
    高露洁要求零售商同时进低利润 SKU 占满货架，从而封锁竞争者渠道。控制货架空间是一种合法且强势的进入壁垒。

  * [14:48–14:49] **Economies of Scale**
    Cloud giants like AWS, Google, Microsoft buy chips 100 000× cheaper per unit than startups. Scale itself becomes an entry barrier; new entrants are locked out.
    云巨头采购芯片单价比初创便宜 10 万倍，规模本身成了壁垒，新玩家几乎无从进入。

  * [14:50–14:53] **Barrier to Exit and Market Destruction**
    Low exit barriers let rivals quit gracefully. High exit barriers cause “fight-to-the-death” price wars that erase margins and ruin the whole market.
    低退出壁垒让竞争者体面离场；高退出壁垒导致“殊死战”，压价到零利润，最终毁掉市场。

  * [14:54–14:57] **Four Exit Paths**
    1️⃣ IPO (based on vision), 2️⃣ Trade Sale (based on synergy), 3️⃣ Dividend/Zombie (based on long-term cashflow), 4️⃣ Liquidation (based on asset transfer). Each needs different infrastructure—finance, HR, strategy. Mismatch between intended and built exit traps founders.
    四种退出方式：① IPO（靠愿景），② 并购出售（靠协同），③ 分红/僵尸型（靠现金流），④ 清算（靠资产流转）。每种模式需不同体系——财务、人力、战略。想走与已建体系不符，会被困住。

  * [14:57–14:58] **Wrap-Up Formula**
    Profit = Σ (Price × Volume) – (People + Production + Promotion + Place), subject to Implementability, Sustainability, and Exit. This completes the investor-focused business logic.
    利润 = Σ (价格 × 销量) – (人力 + 生产 + 推广 + 渠道)，并同时满足可执行性、可持续性与可退出性。这就是面向投资者的完整商业逻辑。
## Week 9 1014
  * [13:07–13:10] **Purpose of the framework**
    This PRFAQ-style framework exists to pre-answer stakeholder questions. It has been validated across many companies. Use it to confirm business soundness, and add any business-specific questions as needed. The goal is to remove fear about “business validation.” It is common sense executed systematically.
    该类 PRFAQ 框架用于预先回答干系人所有问题，已被大量公司验证可用。用它来确认商业可行性，并根据项目补充专属问题。目标是消除对“商业验证”的畏惧，把常识系统化执行。

  * [13:11–13:12] **Value section scope**
    The Value “V” includes ~54 questions and should be easiest now because you already did customer validation. Reuse findings, but describe them well.
    价值部分约 54 个问题。因为已完成客户验证，所以最容易。重复使用你的发现，但要更好地表述。

  * [13:12–13:13] **Cognitive + emotional goals**
    Each section has intellectual content and emotional intent. In Value, make readers understand the pain and also feel it. The gold standard is when investors emotionally connect with the customer’s pain.
    每个章节既要有理性信息，也要有情感诉求。在价值部分，要让读者既理解痛点也“感同身受”。理想效果是让投资人对客户痛点产生情绪共鸣。

  * [13:13–13:14] **Customer narrative and evidence**
    Don’t dump facts. Tell a short customer story, then show your validation: interviews run, experiments, pivots, and what remains unvalidated. Make gaps explicit.
    不要只给数据。先讲一个简短的客户故事，再给验证证据：访谈数量、实验、转向，以及尚未验证之处。把空白点明说清。

  * [13:14–13:15] **Problem statements and tests**
    State your problem hypotheses, the validation you ran, and what is still untested. Same structure as customer description.
    给出问题假设、验证过程与结果，以及仍未验证的点。结构与客户描述相同。

  * [13:15–13:16] **Urgency and intensity**
    Define urgency/intensity and then quantify them. Don’t assert—measure. Choose metrics that translate “pain” into numbers.
    先定义紧迫度/强度，再量化。不能只口说，要测量。选取能把“痛”转成数字的指标。

  * [13:16–13:16] **Early adopters and current journey**
    Prove early-adopter traits: awareness of the problem and active attempts to solve it. Map the current workaround journey and where dissatisfaction persists.
    证明早期采用者特征：知道问题并主动尝试解决。画出现有替代方案流程，并标出仍不满的环节。

  * [13:16–13:19] **When pain is “soft”**
    For hard-to-quantify spaces (social, wellness), use before/after or stated-preference surveys. Example: 1–10 scales for urgency; A/B prototypes; willingness-to-pay; time saved; conversion/retention deltas among early adopters.
    在社交、健康等难量化领域，使用事前/事后或偏好调查。例如：1–10 紧迫度量表、A/B 原型、愿付价格、节省时间、早期用户的转化/留存差异。

  * [13:20–13:20] **Team work block**
    Review your Value prompts, check answers, then sit with them as a team. Refine both logic and emotion.
    回看价值部分的提示与答案，小组一起打磨理性与情感两条线。

  * [14:11–14:12] **Data → story → emotion**
    Convert data into a persuasive story that elicits the intended emotion tied to customer pain and desired outcomes.
    把数据转成能激发目标情绪的故事，连接客户痛点与期望结果。

  * [14:12–14:14] **TAM, SAM, SOM definitions**
    TAM: everyone who could buy does buy—global, 100% share assumption. SAM: your first target segment (beachhead). SOM (sometimes “SONG” here): the share you can win in SAM, typically 20–35% in a mature steady state.
    TAM：只要“可能买”的人都购买的总量，假设全球 100% 市占。SAM：你的首个目标细分（滩头阵地）。SOM：在 SAM 中可获得的份额，成熟稳态通常 20–35%。

  * [14:15–14:16] **Counting heads and dollars**
    Size markets by people (or units) and value. Value ≈ buyers × price, consistent with your business model.
    规模既看人数/数量也看价值。价值 ≈ 购买者数 × 单价，并与商业模式一致。

  * [14:16–14:19] **Example 1: fish-wrapping tech**
    Don’t use fish sales as TAM if you sell wrapping. Compute by units wrapped × ASP of wrap, not the value of fish. If tech extends to other proteins, add those as bowling pins in TAM, still priced as wrap revenue.
    若你卖的是保鲜包装，TAM 不应使用“鱼的销售额”。按“被包装的单位数 × 包装 ASP”计。扩展到鸡、牛等属于后续保龄球瓶，但仍按“包装收入”计价。

  * [14:22–14:27] **Example 2: low-calorie juice yeast**
    If you sell B2B yeast to juice brands, TAM is processing revenue per liter × liters, not the $17B retail juice market. If you switch to selling your own B2C juice, then retail juice TAM applies. TAM forces you to state the business model clearly.
    若你以 B2B 向饮料厂卖酵母，TAM 是“每升加工收入 × 升数”，而非 170 亿美元的零售果汁市场。若改做自有 B2C 果汁，才能用零售 TAM。计算 TAM 的过程迫使你明确商业模式。

  * [14:27–14:28] **Why TAM still matters**
    TAM is rarely reachable. Its value is aligning on the model and revenue locus. Treat it as a modeling checkpoint, not a forecast.
    TAM 几乎不可达。其意义在于统一“我们怎么赚钱”的模型与位置。把它当建模校验点，而非预测。

  * [15:15–15:20] **Fixing the 1% trap**
    Teams shrink SOM to 1% to look “realistic.” That is wrong. Don’t make a smaller fish; make a smaller pond. Apply pressure to SAM by narrowing: region → cities → income bands → age → sub-demographics, until a 20–35% target share is defensible.
    常见错误是把 SOM 缩到 1% 以显“现实”。不要把“鱼”变小，要把“池塘”变小。通过收紧 SAM（地区→城市→收入→年龄→亚群体）直到 20–35% 目标份额可防守。

  * [15:24–15:26] **Choosing the beachhead**
    Attractive segments have paying customers, clear access, and advantages you can leverage. There is no recipe. Justify why this segment is better for your team and model.
    好的细分具备付费意愿、易触达且可发挥你方优势。没有统一公式，要能说清“为何对我们更好”。

  * [15:26–15:26] **SOM over time**
    Use a five-year pro forma. SOM should ramp by year, not jump to 30% in year one.
    用五年财务预测。SOM 按年份爬坡，第一年不要直接写 30%。

  * [15:27–15:28] **Top-down is approximate**
    No top-down ever matches reality. The goal is plausibility, not precision. Use bottom-up to sanity-check.
    自上而下不可能精确。目标是“可信”，不是“精确”。用自下而上校验合理性。

  * [15:28–15:33] **Bottom-up constraints**
    Identify limiting factors: sales capacity, production throughput, support bandwidth, etc. Example B2B sales: 3 reps × 5 calls/day × 20 days × 12 months = 3,600 calls/year. With 1 proposal per 5 calls ⇒ 720 proposals. With 30% win rate ⇒ 216 deals/year. That caps annual deals unless you add capacity.
    找出限制因子：销售产能、生产瓶颈、客服带宽等。B2B 例：3 名销售 × 5 次/日 × 20 天 × 12 月 = 年 3,600 次拜访；5 次出 1 份方案 ⇒ 720 份方案；30% 中标 ⇒ 216 单/年。这是上限，除非扩产能。

  * [15:33–15:35] **Reconciling both views**
    Move SAM narrower, tune price/revenue model, and invest to raise capacity until top-down and bottom-up are “close enough.” If far apart, revisit assumptions and iterate.
    通过收紧 SAM、调整定价/营收模型，并投资扩产能，让上下两算“接近即够”。若偏差大，就回到假设重算与迭代。
## Week 10 1023
  * [13:11–13:13] **Explaining pain points and linking to features**
    When you explain how your solution addresses customer pain points, don’t just list features in a table. Use narrative sentences to show which features solve which pains. If one pain requires multiple features, present them together clearly. The goal is to show that every feature exists to delight the customer, not just to look impressive.

    说明你的解决方案如何对应客户痛点时，不要只是表格罗列功能，而要用几句话叙述清楚每个功能解决的痛点。如果一个痛点需要多个功能来应对，就一起说明。重点是让读者看到你设计功能的出发点是“让客户满意”，而不是单纯“堆功能”。

  * [13:13–13:14] **Validation process and evidence**
    As in the “Value” stage, describe what experiments you ran to validate the solution. Include what you did, what you learned, and what remains untested. If you haven’t had time to test everything, acknowledge that. These three parts—action, insight, and gap—complete the validation story.

    和之前“价值”阶段一样，要描述你如何验证方案：做了什么、学到了什么、还有哪些没时间验证。包括未完成部分，能让你的验证过程更完整可信。

  * [13:14–13:15] **Proving feasibility (“Does it work?”)**
    After showing the customer would be delighted, prove that your solution truly works. Evidence can include regulatory approvals, benchmarks, testimonials, or endorsements. If you don’t yet have these, outline your plan for collecting proof over the next few months.

    在说明客户会喜欢之后，还要证明方案真的“能用”。证据可以是监管认证、测试结果、用户推荐等。如果暂时还没有，就说明未来几个月打算如何验证。

  * [13:15–13:16] **Customer usage and prototypes**
    Explain how the customer will actually use your product. Provide photos or mock-ups from your testing. If it’s an app, wireframe the user flow. Tangible visuals help investors imagine the customer’s experience and confirm that it matches your claims of delight.

    讲清楚客户如何真正使用你的产品。可以展示实验时的使用照片或原型图。如果是应用类产品，就画出交互线框。让读者能看到、能感受到客户的体验，这比空讲更有说服力。

  * [13:16–13:18] **Building and scaling the solution**
    Describe how you will produce or deploy the solution at scale. For physical products, mention manufacturing and logistics; for software, show your cloud architecture. Add a Gantt chart of major milestones—design, testing, deployment, approvals, etc.—to prove you’ve thought through the delivery plan.

    说明你将如何把方案从小样扩展到大规模落地。硬件要讲制造和物流，软件要展示系统架构。配上一张关键里程碑图（比如设计、测试、上线、审批等），让人看到你的计划是现实可行的。

  * [13:19–13:20] **Valid canvas exercise**
    On the Miro board, fill in the one-to-one table mapping pain points to features, and estimate how you’ll measure customer delight. You’ll use this table again later for competitor comparison.

    在 Miro 画布上完成痛点与功能的一一对应表，并试着想办法衡量客户满意度。这张表后面还会用来做竞品比较。

  * [13:34–13:35] **Preparing for pitching experiments**
    Before presenting, conduct a few pitching or actualization experiments with 5–10 personas you interviewed earlier. If time is short, at least outline your plan for running them.

    在展示前，找回之前访谈过的 5–10 位典型用户做小规模“推介实验”。如果时间不够，也要说明未来要怎么做。

  * [13:35–13:40] **Valunique: redefining competitors**
    Competition proves value exists. Strong competitors like Microsoft signal a valuable market. The key question is how you defend your position. The AirAsia case shows that competitors are not always those with the same product, but those solving the same customer pain. AirAsia’s true rival wasn’t Singapore Airlines—it was long-distance buses. A “competitor” is anyone solving the same pain, regardless of technology.

    竞争的存在说明市场有价值。强劲对手（如微软）意味着赛道大。关键是你如何防守。以亚航为例，它真正的竞争对手不是新航，而是长途巴士。竞争者不一定产品相同，而是解决同样客户痛点的人或机构。

  * [13:44–13:47] **Competitor comparison method**
    When comparing competitors, don’t rely on 2×2 charts. Use the same rows from your “Valid” table—pain points, features, and performance levels—and compare how well each competitor addresses each pain. If data isn’t public, make reasonable estimates or test their product yourself.

    做竞品分析时，不要用常见的二维坐标图。直接沿用前面“验证”表格的行（痛点、功能、表现水平），对比每家在每个痛点上的解决效果。如果资料不公开，就自己试用产品或合理推测。

  * [14:09–14:11] **Continuous competition awareness**
    Competition never stops. Keep experiencing competitor products—open accounts, use their services, and observe their updates. This should be an ongoing habit, not a one-time table.

    竞争是动态的，要持续体验和观察对手。去注册他们的账号、用他们的产品，养成长期关注的习惯，而不是只在做表格时研究一次。

  * [14:30–14:33] **Internal FAQ and Spark Tank setup**
    Compile everything from the seven V canvases into your internal FAQ and PR/FAQ document. This becomes your Business Hypothesis. You’ll then test it in the “Spark Tank,” similar to Shark Tank but focused on feedback from internal stakeholders (CFO, CEO, etc.) instead of investors.

    把七个 V 画布的内容整合成内部 FAQ 和 PR/FAQ，这就是你的商业假设。接下来在“Spark Tank”实验中测试它——类似 Shark Tank，但评审是公司内部高层，他们会基于文档提问和打分。

  * [14:35–14:37] **Spark Tank outcomes**
    After Q&A, the panel rates you as:
    • Pivot — insufficient evidence, redo major validation.
    • Budding — good idea, but minor validation gaps remain.
    • Compelling — convincing enough to get next-phase funding (1–3 months).

    问答结束后，评委会给出三种结果：
    • Pivot（转向）：证据不足，需要大改。
    • Budding（萌芽）：方向好但验证不够，补点数据再来。
    • Compelling（有说服力）：验证充分，可获下一阶段资助（约 1–3 个月）。

  * [14:40–14:42] **Value Chain: selling perspective**
    The Value Chain is split into two: selling and operations. The selling side is about *relevance*—selling in a way that fits how customers want to buy. Instead of traditional funnels, work backward from the buyer’s process.

    价值链分两部分：销售与运营。销售部分的核心是“相关性”——你的销售方式要符合客户的购买习惯。不要只想着推销流程，而要从买家的购买路径反推。

  * [14:44–14:50] **Buyer’s journey vs seller’s funnel**
    Traditional sales start with marketing, pitching, negotiating, and closing. But buyers go through awareness, search, comparison, purchase, and post-use. Working Backwards flips the focus—design your sales and marketing to guide customers through *their* journey, not your funnel.

    传统销售是营销→推介→谈判→成交；但买家的流程是认知→搜索→比较→购买→使用。Working Backwards 要求围绕买家旅程设计销售策略，帮助他们顺利完成每一步，而不是只推进成交。

  * [14:51–14:52] **Growth hacking = experiments on selling**
    Every sales tactic is a hypothesis: *If we do X, customers will buy.* Apply the scientific method—observe, hypothesize, experiment, analyze—to test which tactics help customers progress. This experimental approach to sales is called *growth hacking*.

    每个销售手段都是假设：“如果做 X ，客户就会买。”用科学方法（观察→假设→实验→分析）去验证哪些策略有效。这种实验式销售思路就叫 growth hacking （增长实验）。

  * [14:53–14:58] **Team exercise: mapping buyer journey**
    Break the buyer journey into stages. Assign each team member one stage to propose hypotheses and experiments for improving it. In B2C, focus may be on awareness; in B2B, on evaluation or tender phases. Adjust based on your business type.

    团队练习：把买家旅程拆成阶段，每人负责一个阶段，提出改进假设和实验方案。B2C 可重点研究“唤起需求”，B2B 则关注“评估或招标”。按你业务实际调整。

  * [15:21–15:24] **Value Chain operations**
    The operational half of the Value Chain covers supply, manufacture, logistics, distribution, sales, and usage. Even software firms have “manufacturing”—coding, servers, and developer resources. Identify key stakeholders at each stage, define what you need from them, metrics for success, incentives, risks, and mitigation.

    价值链的运营部分包括原料、生产、物流、分销、销售和使用。即使是软件公司也有“制造”环节（代码、服务器、工程师）。列出各环节关键人、你要他们做什么、衡量指标、激励方式、风险及应对。

  * [15:46–15:48] **Completing the Working Backwards cycle**
    By now you’ve finished customer, solution, and business validation. The Spark Tank closes the Business Validation loop—pivot, budding, or compelling leads either back to refinement or forward to venture building. The full cycle is observation → hypothesis → experiment → analysis → iteration.

    至此你已完成客户验证、方案验证和商业验证。Spark Tank 的结果决定是回去修正（Pivot/Budding）还是进入创业实施（Compelling）。完整循环是观察→假设→实验→分析→迭代。

  * [15:49–16:01] **Final reflection and assignment**
    The final essay (≤ 2 pages) asks you to reflect on what you’ve learned—problem-solving mindset, design-thinking approach, AI insights, and how you’ll stay relevant in a fast-changing world. Submit by Week 12. The key takeaway: entrepreneurship is structured problem-solving; keep using this mindset beyond the course.

    期末作业是一篇不超过 2 页的反思短文，总结你在课程中的收获——问题解决思维、以人为本的设计思路、AI 应用体会，以及如何在快速变化中保持竞争力。第 12 周提交。核心理念：创业本质是系统地解决问题，把这种思维延续到今后生活与工作中。

# Points for quiz
## Week 2 学习要点
  1. Golden Circle Model (*Start With Why*)
    * Simon Sinek’s framework: **Why → How → What**.
    * People don’t buy *what* you do; they buy *why* you do it.
    * **Why** = purpose, cause, belief.
    * **How** = process, differentiators.
    * **What** = product/service.
    * Used to inspire action and define strategy from the inside out.
  2. Working Backwards (Amazon framework)
    * **Principle:** Define the *end customer experience* first, then work backwards.
    * **Key deliverables:**
      1. **Press Release (PR)** – pretend product already launched, write news article.
      2. **FAQ (external & internal)** – customer & stakeholder questions.
      3. **User experience storyboards** – visualize how users interact.
      4. **Development begins only after PR/FAQ are solid.**
    * Benefits: ensures clarity, customer focus, prevents wasted development.
  3. Design Thinking
    * **Human-centered approach** to solve complex/ambiguous problems.
    * **5 stages:** Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test (cyclical).
    * Focus on **finding the right problem** before solving it.
    * Values diversity of thought, collaboration, rapid prototyping, and iteration.
  4. Lean Startup
    * Proposed by **Eric Ries**.
    * Goal: validate business assumptions with **minimal resources, fast iteration**.
    * **Build → Measure → Learn loop**.
    * Build MVP → test with real users → learn → pivot or persevere.
    * Reduces waste, increases chance of finding sustainable business model.
  5. Double Diamond Model
    * UK Design Council (2005).
    * **Two diamonds = divergence + convergence cycles.**
    * **Problem space:** Discover (diverge) → Define (converge).
    * **Solution space:** Develop (diverge) → Deliver (converge).
    * Emphasizes: **spend time finding the right problem before solving it.**
  6. Customer / Solution / Business Validation
    * **Customer Validation:** Does a real customer exist with a real problem?
    * **Solution Validation:** Does the solution delight the validated customer?
    * **Business Validation:** Can we make money selling this solution?
    * Mirrors **scientific method:** Observation → Hypothesis → Experiment → Analysis.
  7. Persona (Week 2 focus)
    * A **specific, semi-fictional customer** (not just a segment).
    * Includes name, age, lifestyle, goals, pain points, behaviors.
    * Should represent **early adopters** (aware of their problem + actively seeking solutions).
    * Helps structure interviews and test product–market fit.
    * **Pain points are categorized by:** urgency, type (emotional/functional), intensity.
  8. Early Adopters vs Majority
    * **Early Adopter:** aware of problem + actively trying to solve it.
    * **Early Majority:** aware of problem but waiting to see proven solutions.
    * **Late Majority:** not aware / not looking for a solution.
    * Key: innovations should target **early adopters first**.
  9. Creativity & Teamwork Rules (Week 2 lecture)
    1. **Don’t stop at first good idea** → aim for best idea.
    2. **Process removes emotion** → use mechanisms (rubric) to avoid fights.
    3. **Innovation is a team sport** → diversity of thought + inclusion needed.

## Week 3 学习要点
  1. Tyranny of the First Good Idea （第一个好主意的暴政）

    * **现象**：人类大脑有固定模式，一旦想到一个“好”主意，就会停止继续发散。
    * **问题**：第一个好主意几乎从来不是最佳想法。
    * **对策**：

      * 先发散 → 收敛。
      * 鼓励团队多样性和讨论，不要过早定案。
  2. MVP vs. MLP

    * **常见误区**：MVP 被错误理解为 *最小可行产品*（a thing to launch）。
    * **正确理解**：MVP = **实验**（Experiment to test a hypothesis），甚至可以没有产品。

      * Instagram 创业例子：在 Central Park 用 Photoshop 假装成“滤镜产品”。
    * **实践建议**：

      * MVP → 实验。
      * 真正推出市场的应该是 **MLP（Minimum Lovable Product，最小可爱产品）**。
      * **不要**发布“可用但无聊”的产品。
  3. Customer Validation（客户验证）

    * **目的**：验证客户是否存在，以及他们是否真的有问题。
    * **四个工具**：

      1. Persona（画像）
      2. Customer & Problem Hypotheses（客户 & 问题假设）
      3. Customer Discovery Interviews（客户访谈实验）
      4. Customer Validation Loop Analysis（验证循环分析）
    * **Persona 四象限**：Facts（事实）Behaviors（行为）Pains（痛点）Goals（目标）。
    * **Goals/Pains 三类**：Functional（功能）Emotional（情感）Social（社会）。
  4. Hypotheses 构建方法

    * **客户假设**：Facts + Behaviors → 句子。例：Janice，25 岁，健康爱好者（Fact），会兑水减少糖分（Behavior）。
    * **问题假设**：Pains + Goals → 句子。例：目标：每天糖摄入 ≤10g；痛点：市面最低糖果汁仍有 11g。
    * **团队流程**：每人独立提出 → 团队讨论 → 收敛成 1 个客户假设 + 1 个问题假设。
  5. Predictions Grid（预测网格）

    * **每个假设元素都是一个预测**：年龄、行为、痛点、目标都要单独测试。
    * **分类优先级**：

      * 红色三角 = 必测
      * 蓝线 = 有条件可测
      * 黄色三角 = 可忽略
    * **关键**：找出 **Riskiest Prediction（最具风险的预测）**。

      * 定义：影响最大、信心最低。
      * 必须优先测试。
  6. Validation Loop（验证循环规则）

    * **两条规则**：

      1. **先往左走**：确保左边所有工具（Persona → Hypotheses → Prediction Grid）干净一致，再往右走。
      2. **一次只走一步**：实验只能回 Prediction Grid，不能直接跳回 Hypotheses。
    * **流程**：

      * 实验 → 验证预测 → 更新 Prediction Grid → 必要时更新 Hypotheses → 更新 Persona。
      * 如果预测被否定，要逐层清理（Pain → Goal → Behavior）。
  7. 信心陷阱 & HIPPO

    * **常见误区**：团队会高估信心（平均自评 75%），但其实 0% 被验证。
    * **HIPPO** = Highest Paid Person’s Opinion（最高薪人的意见）。

      * 典型失败模式：老板随意想法 → 团队花几百万开发 → 最后发现客户/问题不存在。
    * **对策**：

      * 不要相信直觉和权威。
      * 相信流程，依赖实验。
  8. 实验规模 & 时间限制

    * **理想情况**：完成 10 个“完全验证”的实验 → 才能进入 Solution Validation。
    * **现实情况**：可能需要 120 个实验循环才能得到这 10 个。
    * **实践技巧**：团队并行（例如 6 人拆成 3 组），减少工作量。
    * **现实提醒**：老板不会给足够时间。保护好“红色三角”（最关键预测）。
  - *一句话总结**： Week 3 核心是——别被“第一个好主意”骗了，MVP 不是产品而是实验；通过 Persona → Hypotheses → Predictions → Experiments 的循环，逐步减少不确定性，用 MLP 取悦客户。
## Week 4 学习要点 Pivot（转向）、Experiment（实验）、Customer Discovery Interviews（客户访谈）
  1. Riskiest Prediction（最具风险的预测）

    * **工具定位**：不是商业优先级工具，而是实验优先级工具。
    * **流程**：Persona → Hypotheses → Predictions Grid → 找到 riskiest prediction → 先测试它。
    * **定义**：影响最大（若错会导致全盘推翻）+ 信心最低（最没把握）。
  2. Early Adopters（早期采用者）

    * **区分标准**：

      * Early adopters = Aware + Attempting（意识到问题 + 正在尝试解决）。
      * Early majority = Aware but Waiting（有意识但观望）。
    * **Persona 象限对应**：Behavior（行为象限）能区分是否为 early adopter。没有行为 → 不是早期采用者。
  3. Pivot（转向）

    * **两种类型**：

      * **Soft Pivot**：调整 persona 内部要素（痛点/事实/假设错了），但基本想法还成立。
      * **Hard Pivot**：实验显示根本性错误，persona 不存在 → 清空白板，从零开始。
    * **态度**：

      * Pivot ≠ 错误 → 而是学习（节省未来时间和金钱）。
      * **Celebrate pivots!**（庆祝转向）。不 pivot 反而说明你没学到东西。
  4. Perseverance vs. Pivoting（坚持 vs. 转向）

    * **Pivoting**：放弃并重建 → 当实验显示假设根本错误时。
    * **Perseverance**：坚持并再实验 → 当实验可能执行不佳或数据不足时。
    * **判断点**：是实验问题还是假设问题？
  5. Experiments（实验类型）

    * **常见实验方式**：

      * Field Observation（实地观察）
      * Facebook Page（虚拟页面实验）
      * Coffee Shop Test（咖啡馆访谈：买杯咖啡换 15 分钟对话）
      * Role Play（团队模拟访谈，提前演练）
    * **设计关键**：像科学实验一样，设计良好才能信任结果。
  6. Customer Discovery Interviews（客户探索访谈）

    **黄金法则**（来源于 *The Mom Test* & Lift 视频）：

    1. **No pitching**（不要推销）。
    2. **No ice cream questions**（不要问“要不要冰淇淋”式的问题，没意义）。
    3. **Pull, don’t push**（拉信息，不要推想法）。
    4. **N of 1 ≠ Proof**（一个人说的不代表有效）。
    5. **Past behavior → future behavior**（过去行为比理想状态更可靠）。
    6. **Stories > Statements**（故事比笼统陈述更有价值）。

    * **关键技巧**：

      * Qualify fast（快速确认是否 persona）。
      * Build trust first（先建立信任）。
      * Script ≠ 照本宣科 → 练习脚本是为了能即兴应变。
      * Intro & Outro 很重要 → 给被访者愉快体验。
  7. Scaling & Segmentation（扩展与细分）

    * **传统方式**：Top-down segmentation（如“18–35 岁男性”） → 粗糙无效。
    * **Working Backwards 方法**：Bottom-up segmentation：

      * 从 persona 出发 → 改变一个事实（如年龄、性别、收入），保持 pains/goals 不变 → 测试是否仍然成立。
      * 得到真正共享同样 pains/goals 的群体 → 形成精准细分市场。
  8. Learning Outcomes（学习成果）

    * **目标**：10 fully validated interviews → 进入 Solution Validation。
    * **现实**：可能需要 \~120 次实验循环（≈20–40 次访谈才能开始真正验证）。
    * **核心收获**：不是“对”或“错”，而是不断丢弃错误假设，逐渐逼近真实。
  - **一句话总结**： Week 4 的核心是 —— **用 riskiest prediction 引导实验 → 通过客户访谈快速学习 → 不断 pivot 直到找到真实的 persona → 再做 bottom-up segmentation 扩展市场**。
