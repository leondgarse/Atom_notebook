  Essay 1 (10 marks), due by 2 October at 6 pm on Canvas.

  In your own words, write a maximum 2000-word essay to address the following problem statement:

  “What are the guiding principles of good problem-solving based on my own analysis of three methodologies: DMAIC, Business Process Re-engineering, and Design Thinking?

  1. Please write in a first-person style, e.g., I analysed, .. I compared and contrasted, I used ChatGPT to search, I found…
  2. Include a section specifically explaining the methodology or approach you used. You may refer to Section 4.3 on how to acknowledge/cite the use of AI in your work. https://ctlt.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Policy-for-Use-of-AI-in-Teaching-and-Learning.pdf#page=5.32
  3. Start your essay with the following declaration:
    I, ___________ (insert your name) _____ hereby declare that I have read and fully complied with NUS's policy on the use of AI for academic work, as well as the rules of plagiarism. If I am found to have breached these rules, I accept that I will face disciplinary action in accordance with NUS students’ conduct.

  Here are the guidelines on use of AI for academic work: https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/ai_guidelines_infographics

  You may use tables, figures, and other graphical tools where appropriate. Use headings and spacing to present a professionally written document.


  **Guiding Principles / Advice (e.g.)**
    - **G1:** Good problem-solving follows a process, where there are stages with different focuses. One should not skip/by-pass any stages.  
    - **G2:** Broadly, these stages are problem definition, establishing the current situation/as-is, identify the targets/to-be, generating ways to move from as-is to to-be, and deciding which way(s) to adopt based on certain criteria, implement them, and put in place control/procedure to sustain/maintain solution (not to revert to old way/situation).  
    - **G3:** Use the appropriate tools based on the context. E.g. photos/videos are used to capture information in situations that are hard to describe in words/numbers. Statistics/numbers can be used if areas where they are possible.  
    - **G4:** It is important to solve the right problem (that is important to the organisation).

  Dear  all,

  This week we will look at the BPR methodology. We will do two exercises, one of which is similar to your analysis of DMAIC, ie. what it is for, the stages and their objectives/deliverables, the tools for the various stages,  etc.  You may find the answers in the long MISQ paper (main paper and appendix), or Gen AI tools. But please ask Gen AI to give you the references that they used. You may even role-play as someone who doesn't trust Gen AI (Prompt: " I don't quite convince by your answers" "Please provide more evidence....")

  Dear all,

  I strongly encourage you to watch all the videos below, and practice the techniques for your group project problem (which should be a problem from your workplace or one that you are facing now).

  On the profit=revenue - cost example being too simple, we are essentially tying to solve the profit problem by improving operation or new revenue sources (and limited ourselves in that direction), assuming that the segment we are in can be "profitable".   In terms of hierarchy (or order of the problems), it would be something like this:

  1. Are we operating in a "profitable" market segment?  (hidden question, question not asked)

  2. Within this segment, can we improve our profit?



  Sometimes we assume the answer to Q1 is yes, and therefore we move straight to Q2. It's worth verifying this before attempting Q2 (even though Q2 is the problem assigned by the owner). He/she might not realise that the segment is no longer profitable (for example, not aware that young people nowadays spend more time online with friends than in person).



  At problem definition stage, we should ask the problem owner or ourselves: why this question, what led to this question, and what are the other questions related to it? This is similar to the first diamond in the Design Thinking approach, where at the Empathise stage, one explores before concluding on the right pain point to address.

# assignment 1
## assignment 1 question
  DMAIC shines best when you’re not chasing vague “innovation” but trying to fix or improve an existing process that already runs but stumbles. It’s built for situations where problems are measurable, recurring, and data-rich—not one-off emergencies or blue-sky brainstorming.
  1. what kind of problems are DMAIC suitable for?

  2. what are the steps/stages involved? why are the stages named / labeled on such a manner?

  3. what defines a successful outcome for a particular stage? what pitfalls should be avoid?

  4. what are the typical tools used at the various stages? why are these tools selected? How do these tools assist the method?
## Q1. What kind of problems are DMAIC suitable for?
  - From the Sime Darby case you shared, DMAIC was applied to reduce **high chemical costs in wastewater treatment**—a problem that had:
    * **Clear business impact** (97% of variable cost came from chemicals, especially Alum and Caustic).
    * **Underlying complexity** (multiple root causes like influent pH, dosing practices, chemical pricing, and chemical type, none of which could be solved by a quick fix).
    * **Data availability** (historical cost and process data, pH readings, turbidity levels) that allowed for measurement, analysis, and validation of improvements.
  - So, in general, DMAIC is best for:
    * Reducing **defects, waste, or costs** in a measurable process.
    * Improving **efficiency, quality, or cycle times** where multiple factors influence performance.
    * Problems that require **structured root cause analysis** instead of intuition-based fixes.
    * Situations where improvements must be **sustainable and verified with data**.
  - It’s less suitable for brand-new process design (that’s what **DMADV** or design thinking is for), or for vague strategic issues without measurable metrics.

  | **Define**  | Clarify *what* problem to solve, why it matters, and who is involved.                | • Sharp problem statement tied to business impact (e.g. “cut cost from 57¢ to 47¢/m³”).<br>• Scope realistic (not too broad/narrow).<br>• Stakeholders aligned (charter, SIPOC, RACI). | • Vague goals (“make it cheaper”).<br>• Scope creep (trying to fix everything).<br>• No buy-in → resistance later.            | • **Project Charter** (scope, timeline).<br>• **SIPOC** (map suppliers–customers).<br>• **VOC/VOP** (align with needs).<br>• **Pareto/Selection Matrix** (pick biggest pain).                                                                          |
  | **Measure** | Establish *how bad* the problem is with reliable data; baseline current performance. | • Baseline data verified.<br>• Process variation quantified (e.g. chemical cost distribution at 57¢/m³).<br>• Measurement system consistent (no operator bias).                        | • Bad/biased data.<br>• Collecting too few data points.<br>• Cherry-picking to fit assumptions.                               | • **Process Mapping/Gemba Walks** (see workflow).<br>• **Control Charts** (check stability).<br>• **Capability Analysis (Cp, Cpk)** (process vs. specs).<br>• **MSA/Gage R\&R** (validate measurement system).<br>• **Histograms** (see distribution). |

  | **Improve** | Create and test solutions to eliminate root causes.                                  | • Solutions linked to root causes (e.g. alum dosing, tannin-based chemical).<br>• Pilot/DOE validates changes.<br>• ROI/cost-benefit proven feasible.                                  | • Pet projects (opinion-driven).<br>• Over-engineering fixes.<br>• Ignoring side effects (fix cost but ruin quality).         | • **Brainstorming + Affinity** (generate solutions).<br>• **Solution/Pay-Off Matrix** (rank by effort vs. benefit).<br>• **DOE** (test factors).<br>• **Pugh Matrix** (compare alternatives).<br>• **Pilot Runs** (trial before rollout).              |
  | **Control** | Lock in the gains; prevent process drift.                                            | • SOPs, checklists, training updated.<br>• Monitoring system in place (SPC, dashboards).<br>• Benefits verified (finance confirms savings).<br>• Gains sustained beyond project team.  | • “One and done” → no monitoring.<br>• No updated SOPs/training (knowledge loss).<br>• Celebrating savings on paper only.     | • **Control Plans/Checklists** (who/what/when).<br>• **SOP Updates** (institutionalize change).<br>• **SPC Charts** (detect drift).<br>• **Dashboards/Audits** (track performance).<br>• **Training & Handover** (ownership).                          |
## Q2. What are the steps/stages involved? Why are they named in such a manner?
  - DMAIC is like a scientific expedition into the jungle of messy business processes. Its five stages — **Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control** — are named in such a way because each one represents a logical, step-by-step way of turning a vague problem into a data-backed, sustainable solution. The names are deliberately plain verbs—each one signals *what the team must do at that stage*.

  - **1. Define**
    * *What happens*: The team defines the problem, scope, goals, and stakeholders. A project charter and high-level process map (like SIPOC: Supplier–Input–Process–Output–Customer) are created.
    * *Why the name*: It forces you to nail down the “what exactly” before running into “how.” Without definition, improvement efforts drift.
  - **2. Measure**
    * *What happens*: Data is collected to establish a baseline of current performance. Tools like control charts, Pareto analysis, or capability analysis are used to check variation and defects.
    * *Why the name*: You cannot improve what you cannot measure. This stage turns complaints (“too expensive!”) into numbers (“57 cents/m³ of treated water”).
  - **3. Analyze**
    * *What happens*: The team digs into data to uncover root causes of the problem. Methods like Fishbone diagrams, 5 Whys, regression analysis, and FMEA (Failure Modes & Effects Analysis) are used.
    * *Why the name*: You already know “what” and “how much” — now you must know “why.” This prevents jumping to solutions without evidence.
  - **4. Improve**
    * *What happens*: Solutions are designed and tested to eliminate root causes. Tools like brainstorming, affinity diagrams, DOE (Design of Experiments), solution matrices, and pilot testing are used.
    * *Why the name*: It’s where change actually happens — you’re no longer studying the disease, you’re administering the cure.
  - **5. Control**
    * *What happens*: Systems are put in place to sustain the gains — control plans, updated SOPs, statistical process control, monitoring dashboards.
    * *Why the name*: Without control, processes slip back into chaos. Control locks in the improvements so you don’t fight the same fire twice.
## Q3. What defines a successful outcome for a particular stage? What pitfalls should be avoided?
  - **1. Define**
    - **Successful outcome:**
      * Clear problem statement tied to business impact (e.g. “Reduce WWTP chemical cost from 57¢ to 47¢ per m³ by June 2016”).
      * Well-scoped project (not too broad, not too narrow).
      * Stakeholders and roles identified (RACI matrix, SIPOC).
    - **Pitfalls to avoid:**
      * Vague goals (“make things cheaper” instead of measurable targets).
      * Taking on too big a scope (trying to “fix everything in the refinery” rather than just the WWTP).
      * Missing stakeholder buy-in (without it, resistance will sink the project later).
  - **2. Measure**
    - **Successful outcome:**
      * Reliable baseline data collected (control charts, capability analysis).
      * Process variation understood (e.g. knowing chemical cost was normally distributed around 57¢/m³).
      * Valid measurement system in place (operators measure the same way, no bias).
    - **Pitfalls to avoid:**
      * Garbage data (measuring inconsistently or with faulty instruments).
      * Rushing into analysis without enough data points.
      * Cherry-picking data that supports a preconceived solution.
  - **3. Analyze**
    - **Successful outcome:**
      * Root causes identified and validated with evidence (not guesses). Sime Darby, for example, proved that influent pH directly drove higher caustic use.
      * Prioritization done (via Cause & Effect Matrix, FMEA).
      * “Vital few” causes separated from “trivial many.”
    - **Pitfalls to avoid:**
      * Jumping to solutions too early (“Let’s just buy cheaper chemicals!” before root cause analysis).
      * Confusing correlation with causation.
    * Blaming people instead of processes (“operators are careless” vs “sensor placement is flawed”).
  - **4. Improve**
    - **Successful outcome:**
      * Solutions directly linked to validated root causes (e.g. optimizing alum dosage, changing supplier, switching to tannin-based chemical).
      * Solutions tested and validated (DOE, pilot runs, pay-off matrix).
      * Cost-benefit analysis shows value and feasibility.
    - **Pitfalls to avoid:**
      * “Pet projects” (solutions based on opinion, not data).
      * Over-engineering (creating complex solutions when simple process tweaks work).
      * Ignoring side effects (a cheaper chemical that ruins water quality isn’t a win).
  - **5. Control**
    - **Successful outcome:**
      * Controls in place: monitoring charts, SOP updates, training, audits.
      * Benefits sustained beyond the project team (institutionalized into the process).
      * Project formally closed with validated financial and performance gains (Sime Darby: 41k USD/year savings, ROI 992%, payback in 1 month).
    - **Pitfalls to avoid:**
      * “One and done” mentality—no monitoring, so the process drifts back.
      * Not updating SOPs or training (knowledge dies when the team moves on).
      * Celebrating savings on paper only, without verification by finance or auditors.
## Q4. What are the typical tools used at the various stages? Why are these tools selected? How do these tools assist the method?
  - **1. Define – Frame the problem**
    - **Typical tools:**
      * **Project Charter** – defines scope, goals, timeline.
      * **SIPOC (Supplier–Input–Process–Output–Customer)** – maps the process at a high level.
      * **Voice of the Customer (VOC) / Voice of the Process (VOP)** – ensures goals match customer/business needs.
      * **Pareto Analysis / Project Selection Matrix** – helps choose the problem with biggest impact.
    - **Why selected:** They turn “we think X is a problem” into “we know Y is the biggest pain, with Z impact.”
    - **How they assist:** Provide clarity and prioritization, align the team, and secure buy-in before heavy lifting starts.
  - **2. Measure – Baseline the process**
    - **Typical tools:**
      * **Process Mapping / Gemba Walks** – visualize current workflow, spot data collection points.
      * **Control Charts (I-MR, Xbar-R)** – check process stability.
      * **Capability Analysis (Cp, Cpk, Sigma level)** – assess how well process meets specs.
      * **Measurement System Analysis (MSA, Gage R\&R)** – verify measurement reliability.
      * **Graphical Summary / Histograms** – understand data distribution.
    - **Why selected:** You need trustworthy numbers before analysis.
    - **How they assist:** Transform gut feelings into hard evidence, prove whether variation is real or just noise.
  - **3. Analyze – Find the root cause**
    - **Typical tools:**
      * **Brainstorming & 5 Whys** – generate possible causes.
      * **Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram** – categorize causes into Man, Machine, Method, Material, Measurement, Mother Nature.
      * **Cause & Effect Matrix** – prioritize causes with biggest impact.
      * **FMEA (Failure Modes & Effects Analysis)** – score risks by severity, occurrence, detectability.
      * **Hypothesis Testing / Regression / Correlation** – statistically prove relationships (e.g. low pH ↔ higher caustic cost).
    - **Why selected:** Humans love to blame the wrong thing; these tools separate “likely suspects” from “true culprits.”
    - **How they assist:** They force evidence-based thinking, filtering dozens of guesses into a handful of proven root causes.
  - **4. Improve – Fix the root cause**
    - **Typical tools:**
      * **Brainstorming + Affinity Diagram** – generate and group possible solutions.
      * **Solution Matrix / Pay-Off Matrix** – rank solutions by benefit vs. effort.
      * **Design of Experiments (DOE)** – test factor interactions and optimize settings.
      * **Pugh Matrix** – compare alternatives against criteria (used for chemical selection).
      * **Pilot Runs / Prototyping** – validate before full rollout.
    - **Why selected:** Solutions must be chosen rationally, not emotionally.
    - **How they assist:** They ensure improvements are both effective and feasible, balancing cost, quality, and effort.
  - **5. Control – Sustain the gains**
    - **Typical tools:**
      * **Control Plans & Checklists** – document what to do, when, by whom.
      * **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Updates** – institutionalize changes.
      * **Statistical Process Control (SPC) Charts** – ongoing monitoring for drift.
      * **Audits & Dashboards (SAP, Excel trackers)** – validate sustained performance.
      * **Training & Handover** – ensure operators own the new way.
    - **Why selected:** Improvements decay if not reinforced.
    - **How they assist:** They lock in success, making the new way “the normal way.”

## Consolidated Guiding Principles of Problem-Solving
  **G1. Good problem-solving follows a process**

  * All methods emphasize structured stages. Skipping steps risks failure.
  * Iteration is useful, but discipline ensures clarity and learning.

  **G2. Each stage has a distinct focus, supported by tools**

  * Stages have different goals: defining, diagnosing, ideating, validating.
  * Tools sharpen thinking but should not become ends in themselves.

  **G3. Decisions must be evidence-based**

  * DMAIC: quantitative data.
  * BPR: benchmarks and business cases.
  * Design Thinking: user research and prototypes.
  * Evidence can be numbers or stories — validation matters more than assumption.

  **G4. Match method to problem context**

  * Incremental problems → DMAIC.
  * Radical transformation → BPR.
  * Ambiguous, user-centered innovation → Design Thinking.
  * No single method is best; fit depends on context and risk appetite.

  **G5. People and culture are central**

  * Workers sustain DMAIC, leadership drives BPR, users shape Design Thinking.
  * Stakeholder buy-in is essential; culture embeds sustainability.

  **G6. Balance risk and reward**

  * DMAIC: low risk, steady gains.
  * BPR: high risk, high return.
  * Design Thinking: uncertain risk, creative payoff.
  * Smart problem-solvers choose consciously where to act.

  **G7. Embrace iteration and learning**

  * DMAIC: feedback loops in Control.
  * BPR: refine after implementation.
  * Design Thinking: prototype-test cycles.
  * Universal cycle: **Plan → Act → Learn → Adjust**.

  **G8. Sustainability is the ultimate goal**

  * Improvement must become habit, not a one-off.
  * Embed solutions into routines, incentives, and culture.

  **Consolidated Advice:**

  - Effective problem-solving is structured and evidence-driven, but also flexible enough to fit context. Tools support thinking, people ensure adoption, and culture sustains results. Each method has limits, so a generic methodology should balance rigor (DMAIC), boldness (BPR), and empathy (Design Thinking).
## Generic Problem-Solving Methodology
  **1. Frame the Problem (Define & Contextualize)**

  * Clarify *what is the problem* and *why it matters*.
  * Understand scope (incremental vs radical vs exploratory).
  * Gather voices: stakeholders, users, business goals.
  * Output: clear **problem statement + hypotheses**.
    → Inspired by **DMAIC’s Define**, **BPR’s Envision**, **Design Thinking’s Empathize/Define**.

  **2. Gather & Interpret Evidence (Measure & Understand)**

  * Collect relevant data:

    * **Quantitative** (metrics, KPIs, costs, performance).
    * **Qualitative** (user stories, observations, emotions).
  * Map processes / journeys / systems.
  * Output: **baseline + diagnosis of gaps**.
    → Inspired by **DMAIC’s Measure**, **BPR’s Diagnose**, **Design Thinking’s Observe/Empathize**.

  **3. Analyze Causes & Opportunities (Diagnose & Reframe)**

  * Use structured tools: fishbone, root cause analysis, benchmarking, journey maps.
  * Ask “Why?” and “What if?” to avoid solving symptoms.
  * Reframe problem if evidence suggests deeper issues.
  * Output: **validated root causes + reframed challenge statement**.
    → Inspired by **DMAIC’s Analyze**, **BPR’s Why/Ideal Way**, **Design Thinking’s Define**.

  **4. Generate & Develop Solutions (Ideate & Design)**

  * Brainstorm widely → quantity leads to quality.
  * Use creativity tools, scenario building, cross-functional workshops.
  * Shortlist ideas based on impact vs effort.
  * Output: **solution concepts or prototypes**.
    → Inspired by **DMAIC’s Improve**, **BPR’s Redesign**, **Design Thinking’s Ideate**.

  **5. Test & Validate (Prototype & Pilot)**

  * Run pilots, simulations, experiments.
  * Gather feedback from users, stakeholders, and data.
  * Refine solutions based on results.
  * Output: **validated solutions ready for scaling**.
    → Inspired by **Design Thinking’s Prototype/Test**, **DMAIC’s Improve validation**, **BPR’s Reconstruct/Evaluate**.

  **6. Implement & Embed (Control & Sustain)**

  * Deploy final solutions at scale.
  * Set up control systems: dashboards, SOPs, cultural reinforcements.
  * Ensure adoption: training, incentives, communication.
  * Output: **sustained improvement embedded into culture**.
    → Inspired by **DMAIC’s Control**, **BPR’s Reconstruct/Evaluate**, **Design Thinking’s Implementation**.

# Concepts
## BPR
  **What is BPR?**
  Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is about throwing away the old rulebook of how work is done and starting fresh. The idea, popularized by Michael Hammer in the 1990 Harvard Business Review article *“Don’t Automate, Obliterate”*, is that most of the tasks inside companies don’t add real value to customers. Instead of just automating those tasks with technology, firms should **radically redesign the process from the ground up**.

  **Why is it radical?**
  Unlike methods like DMAIC (which focus on incremental improvements, usually <10%), BPR aims for **dramatic performance jumps** (>50%) in cost, quality, service, or speed. It’s like redesigning the road system of a city rather than just fixing potholes.

  **Why is it difficult?**

  * Processes are often invisible and spread across departments, so nobody sees the whole picture.
  * People resist change — sticking to old habits is easier.
  * Managers sometimes misuse BPR as a cover for mass layoffs, earning it a bad reputation for dehumanising workplaces.

  **The Framework (Kettinger, Teng & Guha 1997)**
  After comparing 25+ BPR methodologies, they distilled a **six-stage framework**:

  1. **Envision**: Create a vision of where the business should go.
  2. **Initiate**: Build commitment, form teams, and plan.
  3. **Diagnose**: Study current processes (as-is), benchmark, measure.
  4. **Redesign**: Generate and prototype “to-be” processes.
  5. **Reconstruct**: Implement the redesigned process with IT, training, and organizational changes.
  6. **Evaluate**: Measure outcomes, audit performance, and connect to continuous improvement.

  **Tools & Techniques mapped to each stage**:

  * **Business Planning**: Benchmarking, Competitive Analysis, Value-Chain Analysis, Cost/Benefit Analysis.
  * **Diagnosis**: Process Flowcharting, Activity Based Costing (ABC), Fishbone, Pareto, Surveys.
  * **Redesign**: Brainstorming, Affinity Diagram, Simulation, Workflow Design, Prototyping.
  * **Implementation**: Project Scheduling (PERT/CPM, Gantt), Training, Conversion techniques.
  * **Evaluation**: Audits, SPC (Statistical Process Control), QFD (Quality Function Deployment).

  **Role of IT**
  BPR is tightly linked with IT as an enabler. For example:

  * EDI (electronic data interchange) to cut out intermediaries in supply chains.
  * Groupware to connect people directly.
  * Robotics to automate physical processes.
  * AI and databases to inject information into decisions.

  **Key Takeaways**

  * BPR = **radical change** vs DMAIC = **incremental improvement**.
  * Needs **top-management support**, cross-functional teams, and heavy use of IT.
  * Success depends on **managing change and people**, not just drawing new processes.
  * Provides a **structured toolbox** (over 70 techniques, 100+ tools catalogued in the paper).

  **In short:** BPR is bold, disruptive surgery for organizations — risky, but potentially transformative.

  **中文解释**

  **什么是业务流程再造 (BPR)?**
  业务流程再造就是把公司运作的“旧规则书”扔掉，从零开始重新设计流程。1990 年，哈佛商业评论上 Michael Hammer 写了一篇著名文章《不要自动化，要彻底重构》。他认为，企业里做的大部分工作对客户没有真正价值。与其用技术去加速这些无价值的工作，不如彻底删掉，重新设计流程。

  **为什么说它“激进”?**
  和 DMAIC 这种追求小步改进（通常小于 10%）的方法不同，BPR 追求的是**大幅度的飞跃性改进**（超过 50%），比如成本、质量、服务或速度。它不是修补旧路，而是直接重建一套新的道路系统。

  **为什么难做?**

  * 流程往往横跨多个部门，谁都看不到全貌。
  * 人性本能抗拒改变，走老路最省力。
  * 有些管理层把 BPR 当作裁员的借口，导致它被批评是“新瓶装旧酒的泰勒主义”，使工作环境更不人性化。

  **六阶段框架（Kettinger, Teng & Guha, 1997 总结）**

  1. **愿景阶段**（Envision）：确立企业未来要达到的愿景和目标。
  2. **启动阶段**（Initiate）：高层表态支持，组建团队，做好项目规划。

  **信息技术的作用**
  IT 是 BPR 的关键推动力：

  * 电子数据交换 (EDI) 可以去掉中间商。
  * 协同软件 (Groupware) 直接连接人和人。
  * 机器人让生产流程自动化。
  * AI 和数据库能把大量信息引入决策中。

  **一句话总结：** BPR 是对组织的大手术，风险大，但成功了就能彻底转型。
## AEIOU observing framework
  - AEIOU is one of those deceptively simple design-thinking frameworks that helps you observe the world in a structured way so you don’t just see *what’s happening*, but also *why it matters*. It’s often used in ethnographic research, customer discovery, and innovation projects. The acronym stands for:
  * **A = Activities** What people are doing. The routines, actions, and processes you can see. Example: in a café, customers order, wait, scroll their phones, chat, sip coffee.
  * **E = Environment** The physical, digital, or social context where the activity takes place. What surrounds people? Example: is the café cozy, noisy, cramped, full of power sockets, or dominated by a big ordering counter?
  * **I = Interactions** How people engage with others, objects, or systems. Example: customer ↔ cashier, customer ↔ payment machine, friends chatting, or even customer ↔ coffee cup.
  * **O = Objects** The physical or digital artifacts in use. These can be tools, devices, or even props. Example: menus, coffee cups, mobile apps, loyalty cards, laptops.
  * **U = Users** The people you’re observing — their roles, goals, demographics, and behaviors. Example: students working on laptops, office workers grabbing takeaway, families lingering with kids.

  The magic of AEIOU is that it forces you to widen your lens. Instead of just watching “what a person does,” you also notice *the stuff, the space, the relationships, and the subtle cues*.

  Design thinkers often use AEIOU observation grids: a table with five columns (A–E–I–O–U) where you jot down what you see. Later, you can mine this grid for insights, spot unmet needs, or frame challenge statements.

  It’s a cousin of **customer journey mapping** and **service blueprinting**, but AEIOU is lighter weight — a portable notebook method for early discovery work.

  Would you like me to sketch a sample **AEIOU observation grid** (say, for a university library or a gym) so you can see how it works in practice?
## MECE
  - Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive 简称 **MECE**。这是一个常用在管理咨询、战略分析里的逻辑框架。
    * **Mutually Exclusive（互斥）**：意思是分类之间不重叠，每个元素只能属于一个类别。比如把人分为“男性”和“女性”，一个人不会同时在两个组里。
    * **Collectively Exhaustive（完全穷尽）**：意思是所有可能的情况都被覆盖了，不会漏掉。比如分类时既有“男性”也有“女性”，那就把所有人都包括进去了。

  合起来，MECE 就是要求我们在分类、拆解问题时：

  1. **不重叠**（避免重复计算/重复考虑）；
  2. **不遗漏**（避免有盲点）。

  举个例子：
  要分析一家电商的客户群体，如果分为「新用户」和「老用户」，这就是 MECE，因为：

  * 一个用户不可能同时既是新用户又是老用户（互斥）。
  * 所有用户都在新用户或老用户里（穷尽）。

  但如果你分成「学生用户」和「老用户」，就不是 MECE，因为：

  * 有人可能既是学生又是老用户（不互斥）。
  * 还可能有既不是学生也不是老用户的顾客（不穷尽）。

  这套方法常被麦肯锡、BCG 之类的咨询公司用来拆解问题。它的核心价值是**逻辑清晰、无遗漏、无重复**。
## Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa diagram)
  - the standard main “bones” are the 6Ms:
    - Man (People) – skills, training, fatigue, motivation.
    - Machine – equipment, tools, maintenance.
    - Method – procedures, instructions, process design.
    - Material – raw materials, consumables, quality.
    - Measurement – inspection, data accuracy, metrics.
    - Mother Nature (Environment) – temperature, humidity, workspace.

## Week 2 Study Guide
  1. MOA Theory (Motivation, Opportunity, Ability)  
    - **Performance = Motivation × Opportunity × Ability**  
    - If any one factor is missing, performance collapses (multiplicative, not additive).  
    - Example:  
      - Motivated + Able, but no Opportunity → no results.  
      - Motivated + Opportunity, but no Ability → no results.  
  2. DMAIC / TQM Basics  
    - **DMAIC** = Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control.  
    - Originated in **factory settings** (Total Quality Management, Six Sigma).  
    - Unique feature: usable by **shop floor operators**, not just engineers/consultants.  
    - Works through **many small teams (3–5% improvements each)** → cumulative impact.  
  3. Define Stage  
    - Identify project scope using **project ranking matrices**:  
      - Low cost, high ROI, short duration preferred.  
    - **SMART problem statements**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound.  
    - Ambiguity matters:  
      - Narrow problem → easier, but less impact.  
      - Broad problem → harder, but greater potential.  
  4. Measure & Analyze  
    - **Measure**: Establish baseline, quantify gaps.  
    - **Analyze tools**:  
      - Fishbone diagram (Man, Machine, Material, Method; sometimes extended).  
      - Cause-effect matrices.  
      - FMEA (Failure Mode & Effect Analysis): Severity × Frequency × Detectability.  
    - Context: works best in **production environments**; less suited for emotional/user-experience problems (contrast with Design Thinking).  
  5. Improve Stage  
    - Brainstorm possible solutions.  
    - Prioritize using **effort vs. return matrix**:  
      - Low effort / High return → Do immediately.  
      - High effort / Low return → Avoid.  
      - High effort / High return → Only if resources/time allow.  
      - Low effort / Low return → Consider only for small wins or compliance.  
    - Quick wins build team confidence; compliance tasks may be necessary regardless of ROI.  
  6. Control Stage  
    - Goal: **institutionalize change** so improvements don’t vanish.  
    - Common issues:  
      - Factories run 3 shifts × 4 crews → easy for habits to revert.  
    - Tools:  
      - SOP updates.  
      - Retraining across all crews.  
      - **Pokayoke (foolproofing)**: design changes that prevent errors (e.g., USB-C, two-hand machine safety buttons).  
  7. Creativity & Habits (Atomic Habits Link)
    - **Creativity = combining diverse Lego bricks of knowledge.**
    - To build Lego bricks: form habits that feed creativity.  
    - *Atomic Habits principles applied:*  
      - Identity: “I am a reader” → more likely to read.  
      - Environment cues: visible books, pleasant reading spaces.  
      - Small wins: 2-minute rule (read 1 page).  
      - Rewards: immediate satisfaction > distant future payoff.  
      - Belonging: peer groups encourage persistence.  
    - Extra habits that boost creativity: daydreaming, traveling, reading outside your field.  
  8. Contrast with Other Methods  
    - **DMAIC**: factory-oriented, quantitative, incremental improvements (5–10%).  
    - **Design Thinking**: empathy-driven, emotional, suited for user experience & unmet needs.  
    - **Lean Startup**: experimentation-driven, market-focused.  
  - Key Takeaways  
    1. **DMAIC thrives in structured, factory-like environments** → systematic, incremental gains.  
    2. **Alignment matters**: many small teams → big impact only if all point toward corporate goals.  
    3. **Control is critical**: without institutionalization, improvements collapse.  
    4. **Creativity requires habits**: diverse inputs, small daily actions, reinforced by identity & environment.  
    5. **Use AI critically**: check references, don’t accept hallucinated outputs.  
## Week 3
  * \[18:07–18:09] **Finding where to act**
    **EN** List causes → assess impact → target the vital few. Pareto: small number causes = big effect. Fixing minor causes fully won’t move the needle.
    **CN** 先列原因 → 判断影响 → 重点解决关键少数。帕累托原则：少数原因占大头。小问题就算解决 100%，整体效果也有限。

  * \[18:08–18:11] **Baselines and issue trees**
    **EN** Always define a baseline. Use issue trees to break down causes (forced vs voluntary decisions). For problems like hotel food waste, quantify current state, set measurable targets, check data validity.
    **CN** 一定要有基线。用问题树拆因（被迫 vs 主动）。像“酒店食物浪费”要先量化现状，设定目标，再确认数据是否真实。

  * \[18:12–18:17] **Choosing a method, keeping logical flow**
    **EN** DMAIC, DT, or generic—method matters less than logical flow: define → analyze with tools → ideate widely → test & implement.
    **CN** 用 DMAIC、设计思维或通用方法都行，关键是逻辑顺：定义 → 工具分析 → 广泛创意 → 测试落实。

  * \[18:24–18:26] **Projects and proxies**
    **EN** If real measures aren’t possible, use proxies. Pick a real problem (ideally a teammate’s). Benefits team + company. Anonymize sensitive data. Slides must be clear, professional, logical.
    **CN** 不能直接测，就用替代指标。选真实问题（最好是组员的）。既帮小组又帮公司。敏感数据要匿名。展示要清晰、专业、有逻辑。

  * \[18:26–18:33] **Habits vs legacies**
    **EN** Good habits help; bad ones become “legacies.” Past logic may be obsolete (WWII horse ritual, family superstitions). The challenge: decide what still matters.
    **CN** 好习惯有益；坏习惯变“遗产”。当年合理的做法可能已过时（如二战牵马动作、家庭迷信）。难点是判断哪些该留，哪些该废。

  * \[18:33–18:36] **Legacy systems and market pressure**
    **EN** Old IT (80s–90s code) = costly + rigid. Outdated org structures linger. Market adds pressure (speedy delivery, fast service). Key: identify and cut what no longer fits.
    **CN** 老旧 IT（八九十年代代码）成本高又僵硬。组织结构也可能过时。市场逼迫效率（外卖快、服务快）。关键是识别并砍掉无用部分。

  * \[18:37–18:41] **BPR vs DMAIC; customer journey and service blueprint**
    **EN** DMAIC = general. BPR = process from customer’s eyes. Tools: journey maps (stages + feelings); service blueprints (frontstage, backstage, support, evidence). Failures often backstage.
    **CN** DMAIC = 通用；BPR = 从顾客视角看流程。工具：旅程图（阶段+感受）、服务蓝图（前台、后台、支撑、证据）。问题常出在后台。

  * \[18:41–18:44] **Design for clarity: Subway and airports**
    **EN** Subway = step-by-step visible choices; glass reduces errors. Airports use signage to cut confusion. Clear process + evidence = smoother flow.
    **CN** Subway：流程透明、步骤一目了然；机场：标识清楚，减少混乱。流程+证据明确，运行更顺畅。

  * \[18:45–18:49] **Process mapping: As-Is and To-Be**
    **EN** Map As-Is first (baseline). Swimlanes = stakeholders. Then brainstorm To-Be: cut steps, handoffs, roles. Example: NUS team used Power Apps to streamline admin flow.
    **CN** 先画 As-Is（基线）。泳道=参与方。再画 To-Be：删步骤、并交接、减参与。例：NUS 团队用 Power Apps 精简行政流程。

  * \[18:50–18:54] **Class exercise: haircut to 20 minutes**
    **EN** Current flow = \~1.5h. Task: redesign to 20 min. Timeline all activities, then brainstorm tech/changes (except haircut itself).
    **CN** 现状 \~1.5 小时。任务：改造到 20 分钟。列时间轴，再脑暴技术或改动（剪发必须保留）。

  * \[19:32–19:36] **QB House: why it succeeded**
    **EN** Japan salons = half-day rituals. Workers wanted speed. QB’s value: time saving. Shops in MRT/malls cut travel. Small footprint = lower rent, no waiting area.
    **CN** 日本理发店=半天仪式。上班族要快。QB 的价值=省时间。开在地铁/商场，路程=零。店小=省租，无等候区。

  * \[19:37–19:41] **Simple innovations: queue lights, tokens, vacuum**
    **EN** Sensors + traffic light = visible wait time. Token payment = no cash. Vacuum = clean exit. Fits urban micro-gaps (20 min delays).
    **CN** 座椅感应+红绿灯显示等待。代币付款免现金。吸尘器清碎发。契合都市碎片时间。

  * \[19:41–19:44] **Updating and competition**
    **EN** QB noticed toilet-near outlets did better (mirrors = self-check). But they lagged in tech vs rivals like K-Cut with apps. Without evolution, you lose.
    **CN** QB 发现厕所旁生意好（照镜子提醒剪发）。但更新慢，被 K-Cut App 抢先。不进化，就会掉队。

  * \[19:44–19:49] **Protecting innovation**
    **EN** Visible processes (glass walls) = hard to patent. Stronger moat = value chain (exclusive locations, loyalty). Defend what’s critical *and* protectable.
    **CN** 流程透明（大玻璃）=难专利。护城河=价值链（独占地段、会员制）。要守住**关键且可防守**的环节。

  * \[19:50–19:52] **Keep evolving**
    **EN** Innovation ≠ one-off. Business model = users + value + service + delivery. Protect layers. For QB: lock MRT/malls, add loyalty, stop copycats.
    **CN** 创新≠一次性。模式=用户+价值+服务+交付。要多层防守。QB 应锁地铁/商场+会员，防模仿者。

  * \[19:52–19:55] **Assignment**
    **EN** Analyze BPR: stages, purposes, pros/cons, tools. Compare across DMAIC, BPR, DT → derive principles.
    **CN** 作业：分析 BPR 的阶段、目的、优缺点、工具。比较 DMAIC、BPR、设计思维 → 提炼原则。

  * \[19:55–19:56] **Admin**
    **EN** Sign attendance, form groups, start projects. Done for today.
    **CN** 完成签到、组队，开始小组项目。今天结束。
## Week 4 Study Guide Design Thinking
  **English**

  * **Stages**: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test (double diamond = problem + solution divergence/convergence).
  * **Why divergence matters**: At first, the “problem” may just be symptoms. Exploration helps reframe or redefine.
  * **Human-centered focus**: Unlike DMAIC/BPR (efficiency, cost), DT handles ambiguous, emotional, hard-to-express needs.
  * **Observation > Surveys**: People may not articulate pain points. Use AEIOU (Actions, Environment, Interactions, Objects, Users).
  * **Process > Technology**: Mastering the methodology ensures repeatability, like a recipe or research method.
  * **Empathy tools**: Pregnancy suit, aging suit, extreme users, or even recruiting users as designers.
  * **Cases**:

    * IDEO Shopping Cart — observation and creativity.
    * Solitary diners — privacy at lunch, social connection on weekends.
    * Milkshake story — same product, different jobs-to-be-done.
    * Gillette in India — failure due to wrong testing context.
    * Air New Zealand — Skycouch/Skynest, reframing long-haul flights.
    * Nokia in Japan — cultural oversight (phones on straps).
  * **Media richness**: Ambiguous problems need rich communication (photos, face-to-face, videos). Lean media works only for clear facts.
  * **Key lesson**: Empathy, observation, iteration → prevent solving the wrong problem and design what people truly value.

  **中文**

  * **阶段**：同理 → 定义 → 创意 → 原型 → 测试（双菱形 = 问题和解法两次发散收敛）。
  * **为什么要发散**：最初看到的常是“症状”，探索能帮助重新界定真正问题。
  * **以人为本**：不同于 DMAIC/BPR 追求效率与成本，设计思维应对的是模糊、情绪化、难以表达的需求。
  * **观察比问卷更重要**：人们未必能说清痛点。用 AEIOU 框架（动作、环境、互动、物件、用户）。
  * **过程重于技术**：掌握方法论才能稳定产出，就像食谱或科研方法。
  * **共情工具**：孕妇服、老化服、极端用户，甚至直接让用户参与设计。
  * **案例**：

    * IDEO 购物车——观察+创意。
    * 单人就餐——午餐重隐私与速度，周末重社交。
    * 奶昔故事——同产品，不同任务。
    * 吉列印度——测试环境错误导致失败。
    * 新西兰航空——Skycouch/Skynest，重塑长途飞行。
    * 诺基亚日本——忽视“挂脖子手机”习惯。
  * **媒体丰富性**：模糊问题需要丰富媒介（照片、面对面、视频），明确事实可用精简媒介。
  * **核心启示**：共情 + 观察 + 迭代 → 避免解决“假问题”，创造真正有价值的方案。

# Lectures
## Week 2 lecture
  **\[2025/8/21 18:13]** We’ll likely come back to creativity later, but first let’s talk about the three methodologies in general. Any questions about the video or topics? You’ve probably seen some of this already: a bit of history, the background, and the names.

  **\[2025/8/21 18:13]** Do you understand what these mean? What does this mean to you? Performance. There’s a theory called **MOA – Motivation, Opportunity, Ability**.

  **\[2025/8/21 18:15]** Imagine you’re very motivated, but you are not chosen to represent Singapore at the Olympics. You’re not given the **opportunity**, so you won’t win a medal no matter how motivated you are. Or maybe you’re motivated and you get the opportunity, but you don’t have the **ability** – you can’t run fast enough. Again, no performance.

  So MOA says: for performance to happen, **all three must align**. If one is missing, the result is constrained. It works almost like multiplication: 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 → a small outcome. It’s not addition; one weak factor drags the whole result down.

  - Total Quality Management (TQM) / DMAIC Context

  **\[2025/8/21 18:17]** What’s special about **TQM / DMAIC**? If you search online or with ChatGPT, you’ll see case studies from the **MAC competitions**. Unlike design thinking projects with Stanford teams and highly educated consultants, many MAC competition teams were shop floor operators.

  These were people with maybe O-level education, sometimes less. By society’s standards, not highly educated – but because they ran the machines in three shifts, they had the **opportunity to observe problems and collect data daily**. They were also **intrinsically motivated**: no matter the job, people take pride in solving problems.

  The methodology gave them **structured tools** to solve problems systematically. A DMAIC team might have one or two engineers, but most were operators. Instead of elite consultants, DMAIC leveraged **an army of small teams** each solving 3–5% of problems. Cumulatively, this had a huge impact on operations.

  **\[2025/8/21 18:21]** That’s why alignment is critical: every small DMAIC team’s work must connect to the corporate goals. If the company wants lowest cost, all small teams must focus on cost reduction. Otherwise, if some improve quality, others features, others cost, the collective impact weakens. DMAIC ensures **alignment + cumulative impact**.

  - Define Stage

  **\[2025/8/21 18:24]** In DMAIC, the first stage is **Define**. Often, there are many possible projects – which to focus on? Teams use a **project ranking matrix**: low CapEx, high ROI, short duration. Once a project is chosen, they zoom in: for example, chemical costs → which material drives the biggest cost? Then target that.

  Sometimes the problem is pre-determined by management (e.g., “reduce cost for this machine”). Sometimes it’s open (“improve efficiency somewhere”). The **ambiguity of definition** matters: more freedom means more searching for the true problem. This is why **defining the problem is the hardest skill**. A good consultant reframes vague client requests into precise, impactful problem statements.

  Good problem statements are **SMART**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound. Without this, teams and managers will argue about whether the problem is “solved.”

  - Measure & Analyze

  **\[2025/8/21 18:29]** After Define comes **Measure** – establish the baseline, quantify gaps. Then **Analyze** – use tools like:

  * **Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagrams** – common categories: Man, Machine, Material, Method (sometimes extended).
  * **Cause-effect matrices**.
  * **FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis)** – scoring severity × frequency × detectability. Reduce risk by lowering any of these factors.

  These are **factory-born tools**, so they map well to manufacturing settings. You can adapt them for services, but context matters.

  - Improve

  **\[2025/8/21 18:45]** At Improve stage, teams brainstorm solutions (affinity diagrams, solution trees), then assess **effort vs. return**.

  * **Low effort, high return** → do first.
  * **High effort, low return** → avoid.
  * **High effort, high return** → depends on resources and timeline.
  * **Low effort, low return** → maybe for small wins or compliance.

  Quick wins matter because they build team momentum. But compliance tasks (e.g., safety regulations) must also be done even if ROI is low.

  - Control

  **\[2025/8/21 18:55]** The final stage is **Control** – sustaining results over time. This is crucial in factories with 3 shifts and multiple crews. Without SOP updates and retraining, improvements vanish as people revert to old habits.

  Tools include:

  * **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) updates**.
  * **Training** across all shifts.
  * **Pokayoke (foolproofing)** design – e.g., machines requiring two-hand operation for safety, or USB-C connectors that fit both ways. These prevent errors and enforce new habits.

  DMAIC emphasizes institutionalization – making change permanent, not a one-off.

  - Creativity & Habits (Professor’s Link to Atomic Habits)

  **\[2025/8/21 19:49]** The professor connected this to James Clear’s *Atomic Habits*. Habits stick when tied to:

  * **Identity** (“I am a reader” → more likely to read).
  * **Environment cues** (visible books, pleasant spaces).
  * **Small wins** (2-minute rule, floss one tooth, read one page).
  * **Rewards** (immediate satisfaction, not just long-term gain).
  * **Belonging** (join reading clubs, peer reinforcement).

  Creativity comes from **collecting diverse “Lego bricks” of knowledge** (reading across domains). Later, when facing problems, the brain recombines them into new solutions. Habits like **reading widely, daydreaming, traveling, and reflection** build these bricks.

  - Closing

  **\[2025/8/21 20:21]** The session closed with:

  * Watch the Week 3 video on **business process improvement**.
  * Group exercise: answer 4 DMAIC-related questions (problems suited for DMAIC, stages & their naming, stage-wise questions in a table, pitfalls).
  * Reminder: use GenAI critically – check references, don’t blindly trust hallucinations.
## Week 3 lecture 08.28
  * \[18:07–18:09] **Finding where to act**

    When you analyze causes systematically, you don’t treat them all equally. First list the possible causes, then assess their significance, and finally decide which ones to target. If the Pareto chart shows a few culprits contributing nearly half of the impact, those are the ones to fix. Even if you fix a small factor 100%, the overall improvement won’t be big.

    系统化分析原因时，不能把所有因素看成一样重要。先列出可能的原因，再判断它们的影响大小，最后决定重点处理哪几个。如果帕累托图显示少数原因占了一半的影响，那就优先处理这些。小问题就算解决到100%，整体改善也不大。
  * \[18:08–18:11] **Baselines and issue trees**

    You must establish a baseline: what’s the current state, and how will each solution perform against it? For example, create an issue tree for why people abandon their plans. In Singapore, some are forced to (lost job, money problems, housing restrictions), while others just change their minds (no time, travel, lifestyle). Similarly, for “How to reduce hotel food waste?”, you need a proper problem statement, quantify the current situation, and define measurable targets. Then check if your data actually matches your claims.

    一定要先搞清楚基线：现在的情况是什么，每个方案对比下来会有什么效果？比如说，画一棵“问题树”，分析为什么人会放弃原来的计划。在新加坡，有些是被迫的（失业、缺钱、搬家限制），有些只是自己改变主意（没时间、要旅行、生活安排）。同样地，“如何减少酒店的食物浪费？”也要先写清楚问题陈述，把现状和目标量化，然后再去核实数据是不是真的能支撑你说的。
  * \[18:12–18:17] **Choosing a method, keeping logical flow**

    Whether you use DMAIC, Design Thinking, or a generic method, the point is logical flow. Over time you won’t need rigid templates—you’ll naturally: define problems clearly, analyze them with the right tools, brainstorm widely for solutions, and then test and implement improvements.

    不管用 DMAIC、设计思维，还是一般的方法，关键是逻辑要顺。慢慢地你就不用死守模板了，自然会做到：把问题说清楚，用合适的工具分析，脑暴出一堆方案，然后再去测试和落实改进。
  * \[18:24–18:26] **Projects and proxies**

    Sometimes you can’t measure the real thing directly, so you use proxies. In your projects, focus on a real problem—ideally one faced by a team member. That way, solving it benefits both the group and the company. If data is sensitive, anonymize it. And when presenting, aim for professional, logical slides—like the ones I’ll share online.

    有些东西没法直接量，就找替代指标。在你们的小组项目里，最好挑一个真实的问题，最好是组员自己碰到的。这样解决了既帮到小组，也帮到公司。如果涉及敏感数据，就做匿名处理。展示的时候要做得专业、有逻辑，就像网上那些好的例子，我会分享给你们。
  * \[18:26–18:33] **Habits vs legacies**

    Habits are powerful when built, but in companies, bad “habits” become legacies. These legacies may have made sense once, but now they just persist. Example: in WWII, two soldiers stood still for three seconds before firing a gun. Nobody knew why—until an old colonel explained they used to hold horses. The horses were gone, but the ritual stayed. Similarly, families keep superstitions like putting certain leaves in baby water—maybe useful when water was dirty, but meaningless today. The challenge is judging which legacies are still relevant.

    好习惯养成了很厉害，但在公司里，坏习惯就变成“遗产”了。这些做法当年有道理，但现在没必要还在继续。比如二战时，炮兵要开火前，两名士兵要站三秒，没人知道为什么，后来一位老上校说：那是以前要牵马。马没了，动作还在。同样，家庭里一些迷信习惯，比如给婴儿水里放树叶，可能以前能起点消毒作用，但今天水质已经很干净了。难点就是要判断哪些传统还管用，哪些该淘汰。
  * \[18:33–18:36] **Legacy systems and market pressure**

    Many companies are stuck with old IT systems coded in 1980s–90s languages. They’re expensive to maintain and limit change. Structures can also be outdated—for example, keeping country-based divisions when digital makes centralization easier. Meanwhile, markets impose pressure: food delivery must be fast, customers expect quick service, and that expectation drives technology, pricing, and policies. The challenge is spotting what’s no longer relevant and cutting it.

    很多公司被老旧 IT 系统绑住了，那些上世纪八九十年代写的代码，维护成本高又不好改。组织结构也可能过时，比如明明数字化能集中运作，却还按国家分部门。同时，市场也在施压：外卖要快，顾客要效率，这种期待会推动技术、定价和政策的调整。关键在于识别哪些东西已经没用了，然后把它砍掉。
  * \[18:37–18:41] **BPR vs DMAIC; customer journey and service blueprint**

    DMAIC is general, BPR is specialized—it focuses on processes from the customer’s view. Students don’t care how NUS departments are arranged; they care if registration and classes run smoothly. Tools like customer journey maps capture stages and customer feelings; service blueprints add frontstage, backstage, support systems, and physical evidence (e.g., signage in hotels). Touchpoints matter, but often backstage failures cause problems.

    DMAIC 是通用的，BPR 更专门——它从顾客角度看整个流程。学生才不关心 NUS 部门怎么分，他们只在乎注册、上课是不是顺利。客户旅程图能画出阶段和顾客的感受；服务蓝图还能加上前台、后台、支撑系统和物理证据（比如酒店里的指示牌）。触点很重要，但往往后台出了问题才会影响体验。
  * \[18:41–18:44] **Design for clarity: Subway and airports**

    Subway makes your steps obvious—pick bread, cheese, filling, meal, pay. Transparent glass lets you see ingredients, reducing mistakes and speeding the queue. Airports do the same with bright signage so passengers don’t crowd customer service just to ask where to check in. Good process design + clear evidence = smoother flow.

    Subway 就是把步骤设计得一目了然——先选面包，再选奶酪，再选配料，最后付钱。透明玻璃让顾客看得清，减少错误、加快队伍。机场也一样，用亮堂的指示牌告诉你值机在哪儿，不至于大家都挤去问客服。流程设计清晰、证据明确，整体就更顺畅。
  * \[18:45–18:49] **Process mapping: As-Is and To-Be**

    BPR uses process maps. Swimlanes show stakeholders (cardholder, merchant, gateway, issuer). Time flows forward; loops are minimized. First map the As-Is process—no improvements, just the current baseline. Then brainstorm: can we reduce steps, collapse handoffs, or cut stakeholders? Example: an NUS team mapped a long admin flow, then streamlined it with Microsoft Power Apps, reducing overall cycle time.

    BPR 用流程图。泳道表示参与方（持卡人、商户、支付网关、发卡行）。时间往前走，尽量少回流。先画 As-Is 流程，不改动，只是现状基线。然后再脑暴：能不能减少步骤？合并交接？减少参与方？比如 NUS 有团队把一条很长的行政流程画出来，再用 Microsoft Power Apps 简化，缩短了整体时间。
  * \[18:50–18:54] **Class exercise: haircut to 20 minutes**

    Task: map the full haircut journey, then redesign it to total only 20 minutes. As-Is: appointment, travel (20–30 mins), wait, wash, cut, dry, pay, travel back—about 1.5 hours. Build a timeline with activities and durations. Then brainstorm new technologies and changes. You must still cut hair—no cheating—but everything else is open.

    课堂任务：把理发的完整流程画出来，再改造到总共只要 20 分钟。现状是：预约、路途（20–30 分）、等待、洗、剪、吹、付款、返程——大约 1.5 小时。先做时间轴，把每个活动的时长写上去。然后脑暴怎么用新技术或新方法改造。注意，剪发必须要有，不能投机取巧，其他环节都可以动。
  * \[19:32–19:36] **QB House: why it succeeded**

    In Japan, salons used to be half-day social rituals. But urban workers wanted speed. QB House’s value was time saving. Travel is the biggest waste, so they put shops in MRTs and malls—travel time = zero. To cut rent, they made shops tiny, no waiting area (because no wait).

    在日本，以前去理发店要半天，还要喝茶、按摩。但城市上班族只想快。QB House 的价值就是省时间。最大的问题是路程，所以他们把店开在地铁站、商场——等于零路程。为了省房租，店开得很小，没有等候区（因为根本不用等）。
  * \[19:37–19:41] **Simple innovations: queue lights, tokens, vacuum**

    QB used seat sensors + traffic lights to show queue times (green = 0, yellow = 5–10 mins, red = 15 mins). Customers could see from afar. Payment was token-based, no cash handling. Vacuum cleaners sucked loose hair so you could leave clean. It fit urban life—waiting + haircut could be slotted into a friend’s 20-minute delay.

    QB 用座椅感应+红绿灯显示排队时间（绿=没人，黄=5–10 分，红=15 分）。顾客远远就能看到。付款用代币，不用现金。吸尘器吸掉碎发，剪完就能干净出门。很适合城市节奏——朋友晚到 20 分钟，你就顺便进去剪个头。
  * \[19:41–19:44] **Updating and competition**

    QB saw outlets near toilets did better—people look in the mirror, realize their hair is long, and walk in. But QB slowed in updating; competitors like K-Cut moved faster with apps and e-queuing. If you don’t evolve, you lose your edge.

    QB 发现靠近厕所的店生意更好——人照镜子发现头发长了，就顺便去剪。但 QB 更新得慢，竞争对手 K-Cut 很快上了 App 和虚拟排队。如果不进化，就会丢掉优势。
  * \[19:44–19:49] **Protecting innovation**

    A Singapore High Court case showed that if your process is fully visible (big windows, no secrets), it’s hard to protect. Patents can be worked around. The stronger moat is in value delivery: e.g., securing exclusive locations or loyalty schemes. The question is: which part of your value chain is both critical and protectable? That’s what you defend.

    新加坡有个高院案例告诉我们：如果你的流程完全透明（大玻璃、大家都能看），就很难保护。专利容易被绕过。最强的护城河其实在价值交付，比如独占好地段，或者用会员体系锁住顾客。要问自己：价值链里哪一环最关键、又能防守？那就重点保护那一环。
  * \[19:50–19:52] **Keep evolving**

    Innovation isn’t one-off. Your model = users + value proposition + service + delivery. To defend it, protect multiple layers. For QB, the key was location. So they should have locked in MRTs and malls, and added customer loyalty. Don’t let copycats gain the same spots, or your advantage disappears.

    创新不是“一锤子买卖”。你的模式 = 用户+价值主张+服务+交付。要保护，就多层防守。对 QB 来说，核心是地段，所以应该锁定地铁站和商场，再加上会员留客。不然被模仿者拿到同样的位置，你的优势就没了。
  * \[19:52–19:55] **Assignment**

    This week, analyze BPR: its stages, purposes, pros and cons, tools and techniques. Many answers are in the paper and handout. Across this course, you’ll compare DMAIC, BPR, and Design Thinking, then extract guiding principles of problem-solving.

    本周作业：分析 BPR 的阶段、目的、优缺点、工具和方法。很多答案在论文和讲义里都有。这门课会让你比较 DMAIC、BPR 和设计思维，然后总结出问题解决的核心原则。

## Week 4 lecture Design Thinking 09.04
  * \[2025/9/4 18:14–18:19] **Time Blocking and Learning Context**
    Sometimes, learning requires a structured environment. For example, I signed up for Masterclass.com, which features big names teaching their craft. But after paying, I realized I rarely watch the lessons. This shows that motivation alone isn’t enough—we need scheduling discipline. One technique is *time blocking*: instead of just writing a to-do list, block out specific time slots in your calendar. For instance, decide that every Wednesday at lunchtime you’ll watch the class video. If possible, do it consistently or even with a group. Videos will get longer over time, so I’ll also try sharing the original lecture slides earlier, so you can preview or review the content. That way, we balance videos with in-class exercises without exhausting you, since tired brains can’t absorb well.

    有时候学习需要一个被“强迫”的环境。比如我注册了 Masterclass.com，上面有很多大人物讲课，但付了钱后我发现自己很少去看。这说明光有动力不够，还需要安排好时间。一个方法是 **时间区块（time blocking）**：不要只是写待办清单，而是直接在日历上划出时间段，比如每周三中午固定看课程视频。最好要形成习惯，甚至可以和同学一起看。之后的视频会越来越长，所以我也会把原始课件先上传，方便大家提前看或复习。这样课堂里就能多做练习，也不会在晚上三小时里太疲惫，因为大脑一旦疲劳，就无法真正吸收知识。
  * \[2025/9/4 18:19–18:21] **Admin & Today’s Plan**
    We’ll sort out quiz comments after class—I’ll review your notes and address common issues. Today is Week 4. Plan: wrap up Design Thinking (analysis + examples). If time permits, preview next week’s “compare & contrast” across DMAIC, BPR, and Design Thinking, because Week 6 has a guest session. Now, let’s dive into Design Thinking.

    课务说明：测验的评论和问题我下课后会统一看，并回复共性问题。今天是第4周，计划把“设计思维”的内容讲完（含分析与案例）。如果时间够，会预览下周的“对比三种方法”（DMAIC、BPR、设计思维），因为第6周安排了嘉宾分享。现在开始进入“设计思维”。

  * \[2025/9/4 18:21–18:27] **Design Thinking Overview & the Double Diamond**
    Many of you have seen the standard five stages: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test. Other scholars label them differently (e.g., Understand/Observe/Visualize/Evaluate & Refine/Implement), but the logic is similar: first clarify the right problem, then explore solutions. What’s distinctive here is the *double diamond*: you diverge *twice*—first to explore and reframe the problem (don’t treat symptoms as the problem), then to brainstorm solutions—followed by convergence to make clear choices. Why is that first divergence (problem framing) so emphasized in Design Thinking but not always in other methods? Because Design Thinking often tackles human-centered, ambiguous contexts (needs, emotions, unspoken pain points). You may not truly know the problem at the start, so you must explore, observe, and sometimes redefine it before solving. Historically, many systems were built around efficiency and utility; only more recently have we foregrounded users’ needs—especially emotional and unarticulated ones.

    概览：大家熟悉的五阶段是「同理 → 定义 → 创意 → 原型 → 测试」。有的资料会用别的名字（如“理解/观察/可视化/评估与改进/实施”），但逻辑相似：先把“对的问题”搞清楚，再去解法探索。其独特之处在于**双菱形**：两次发散与收敛——先对“问题”发散，广泛探索与重新表述（别把症状当问题本身），再对“解法”发散头脑风暴，最后收敛做选择。为什么设计思维特别强调前半段的“问题发散”，而其他方法不一定？因为它常处理**以人为本**、高度模糊的场景（需求、情绪、说不清的痛点），一开始未必真正知道“问题是什么”，必须先**观察与共情**，必要时**重定义问题**，再谈解法。从历史上看，很多系统先追求效率与效用；而近年我们才更强调用户需求，尤其是情绪和未被表达的需求。
  * \[2025/9/4 18:22–18:27] **Why Divergence Matters in Design Thinking**
    In Design Thinking, the first stage is often divergent: instead of rushing to solutions, you take time to really explore what the true problem is. Many times, what we see first is only a symptom. Through empathy and definition stages, you may reframe the problem, or even find that the “real” problem is different from what you started with. This makes sense because Design Thinking usually tackles human-centered challenges—where emotions, unspoken needs, and even confusion make it hard to pin down issues clearly. In contrast, methods like DMAIC often target efficiency or cost, which are more tangible and clearly measurable. That’s why Design Thinking emphasizes exploration and reframing of the problem space.

    在设计思维里，第一阶段往往是**发散的**：不是马上跳到解决方案，而是花时间去弄清楚真正的问题是什么。很多时候，我们一开始看到的只是“症状”。通过“同理心”和“定义”两个阶段，你可能会重新表述问题，甚至发现真正的问题和最初设想的不一样。这是因为设计思维常常面对的是**以人为中心的挑战**——涉及情绪、潜在需求，甚至连用户自己都说不清楚的问题。相比之下，像 DMAIC 这种方法更常用在提升效率或降低成本等目标上，这些更具体、可量化。所以设计思维特别强调要先探索和重新界定问题空间。
  * \[2025/9/4 18:27–18:31] **From Efficiency to Human-Centered Design**
    Why wasn’t human-centered design always emphasized? In earlier decades, especially in places like hospitals in the 1990s, the focus was purely on efficiency—patients queued in strict order, no privacy, minimal concern for emotions. The same mindset shaped Singapore’s urban planning: maximize land use, build compact, high-rise facilities. But newer designs, like UTown at NUS, show a shift. UTown has more greenery, open study spaces, cafes, and a 24/7 Starbucks—making it easier for students to interact, collaborate, and learn. Compact layouts may be efficient, but they don’t always foster creativity or community. Design Thinking reminds us that good environments encourage serendipitous encounters, social connection, and comfort, all of which support knowledge sharing.

    为什么以前没有强调“以人为本”的设计？在过去的几十年里，尤其像 90 年代的医院，重点完全在效率——病人排队按顺序，没有隐私，对情绪几乎不考虑。同样的思维也影响了新加坡的城市规划：尽量压缩空间、盖高楼、提高利用率。但新的设计，比如 NUS 的 UTown，体现了转变。UTown 有更多绿化、开放自习区、咖啡馆，甚至 24 小时的 Starbucks——让学生更容易互动、合作和学习。紧凑布局虽然高效，却不一定有利于创造力和社区氛围。设计思维提醒我们，好的环境要能促进偶遇、社交和舒适感，而这些都是知识分享的重要条件。
  * \[2025/9/4 18:31–18:35] **Spaces, Interaction, and Classic IDEO Case**
    One-North was originally designed by JTC with an efficiency mindset—similar to building factories. The goal was to maximize utility, but that meant people working there rarely bumped into each other. After COVID, they even changed escalator directions to encourage more interaction. This shows a key point: environments designed purely for efficiency often fail at fostering collaboration. Airports highlight the same principle—well-designed layouts help passengers find check-in counters quickly, reducing stress and chaos. These examples set the stage for IDEO’s famous shopping cart project. In the 1990s, IDEO demonstrated how observation and design thinking could radically reimagine everyday objects, propelling them into global recognition.

    One-North 最初是由 JTC 按照建工厂的思维来规划的，重点是最大化利用率，但结果是大家在那儿很少真正碰面。疫情之后，他们甚至调整了扶梯的运行方向，目的就是让人们更容易互动。这说明一个关键点：如果环境只考虑效率，就很难促进合作。机场也体现了同样的道理——好的设计能让乘客迅速找到值机柜台，避免混乱和抱怨。这些例子引出了 IDEO 的经典购物车案例。上世纪 90 年代，IDEO 展示了如何通过观察与设计思维，彻底重新想象日常物品，并因此获得全球声誉。
  * \[2025/9/4 18:35–18:41] **Observation and IDEO’s Strength**
    IDEO’s shopping cart video highlights the power of observation. Why observe instead of only asking people? Because what users say and what they actually do can be very different. Behavior is shaped by context, and people often can’t fully articulate their struggles. That’s why IDEO uses structured observation tools like the **AEIOU framework**—looking at Actions, Environment, Interactions, Objects, and Users. Their strength isn’t deep expertise in any one technology, but mastery of the *process*: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test. This process orientation allows them to generate creative, repeatable solutions across industries. Mastering methodology is like mastering a recipe—once you know the steps, you can produce reliable results, rather than being a one-hit wonder.

    IDEO 的购物车视频强调了“观察”的力量。为什么要观察，而不是只做问卷？因为用户说的和实际做的常常不一样。行为受环境影响，而人们往往无法完整表达自己的困难。所以 IDEO 会用 **AEIOU 框架** 来观察：动作 (Actions)、环境 (Environment)、互动 (Interactions)、物件 (Objects)、用户 (Users)。他们的优势不是在某个技术领域特别精，而是**擅长过程**：同理、定义、创意、原型、测试。正是这种“过程导向”，让他们能跨行业持续提出有创意的解法。掌握方法就像掌握食谱——熟悉步骤，就能稳定产出，而不是偶尔碰巧成功。

    Got it — I’ll take the whole remaining section of your transcript (18:41–19:22 and beyond) and smooth it into structured lecture notes with **English + Chinese**. I’ll preserve the classroom tone, anchor it with the materials from the Design Thinking handout, and keep the same block style.
  * \[2025/9/4 18:41–18:47] **Why Process Matters More Than Technology**
    IDEO openly says: “We are not technology experts, but we are experts in the *process*.” Mastering process is more powerful than mastering any single tool. With a good method, you can consistently solve problems across domains. Without it, you might succeed occasionally by luck but fail unpredictably. Think of sports or cooking—there are techniques, not just raw talent. In research too, methodology is the gold standard: because frontier problems have no known answers, we judge credibility by the rigor of the process, not the result. In short, *process discipline gives repeatability and trust*.

    IDEO 明确表示：“我们不是技术专家，但我们是**过程的专家**。”掌握过程，比掌握单一技术更有力量。有了方法，就能跨领域持续稳定地解决问题；没有方法，可能偶尔靠运气成功，但大多数时候不可控。就像运动或烹饪，都有技巧和套路，而不仅仅是天赋。在科研里也是一样：前沿问题没有现成答案，所以可信度来自过程的严谨，而不是结果本身。总结一句：**过程的规范，带来可重复性和信任感**。

  * \[2025/9/4 18:47–18:54] **Observation in Practice: Restaurants and Solitary Diners**
    Observation reveals needs people won’t say. For example, designing for solitary diners: in Japan, cubicles give privacy because eating alone can feel socially awkward. Many people use their phones while eating, not just for entertainment but also to reduce that stigma. At lunchtime, solitary diners want speed and minimal interaction. On weekends, people who live alone may go out hoping for social connection—so a bar counter where chefs chat with customers creates engagement. Same context (eating alone), but different *jobs-to-be-done* depending on time and setting.

    观察能发现人们不会说出口的需求。比如单人就餐：在日本，隔间提供隐私，因为独自吃饭可能带来社交尴尬。很多人用手机，不仅是娱乐，更是掩饰孤独。午餐时，独自就餐者追求快速和少交流；周末时，独居者可能希望社交，于是吧台与厨师互动的设计就能增加参与感。看似同样是“独自吃饭”，但不同场景下的\*\*待完成任务（job-to-be-done）\*\*完全不同。

  * \[2025/9/4 18:54–19:00] **Jobs-To-Be-Done: The Milkshake Story**
    Harvard’s “milkshake story” illustrates this. Morning commuters bought milkshakes because they’re thick, last long, and can be drunk with one hand during boring drives. Parents bought them in the evening for kids, but smaller sizes were better—otherwise kids took too long. The same product serves different “jobs”: keeping drivers occupied in the morning vs. keeping kids happy at dinner. The lesson: don’t just optimize the product—study *context* and *purpose*.

    哈佛的“奶昔故事”很好地说明了这一点。早高峰的上班族买奶昔，是因为它浓稠、能喝很久、开车时单手就能搞定，缓解通勤无聊。晚上父母买奶昔给孩子，但这时小杯更合适——否则孩子喝太久，家长会烦躁。相同的产品，在不同场景下承担不同的“任务”：早晨是陪伴司机，晚上是取悦孩子。启示是：**不要只改产品，还要研究场景和目的**。

  * \[2025/9/4 19:01–19:04] **Observe in the Real Setting: Gillette in India**
    Gillette failed when it tested razors for India using Indian students in Boston. Those students shaved with bright lights, large mirrors, and running water—totally unlike rural India, where men shaved outdoors with small mirrors and a single pail of water. The blades clogged easily. The real issue was not shaving technique but the *environment*. Lesson: always observe in the *authentic context*, not a proxy.

    吉列曾在为印度设计剃须刀时失败过。他们找在波士顿的印度留学生做测试，但这些学生用的是明亮的灯光、大镜子和自来水，与印度农村户外小镜子、一桶水的环境完全不同。结果刀片容易堵塞。真正的问题不是剃须方式，而是**环境差异**。启示是：观察必须在**真实场景**中，而不能用替代品。

  * \[2025/9/4 19:04–19:13] **Empathy Tools: Experiencing the User’s World**
    When direct observation isn’t possible, designers simulate. Ford used a “pregnancy suit” so male engineers could feel what driving while pregnant is like. MIT researchers use aging suits to simulate 80-year-old vision and mobility. Volvo once created a car “by women, for women,” and IDEO even hired a 91-year-old designer to focus on elderly needs. Best of all, if the *users themselves* design, insights are strongest—but since not all users have design skills, simulation bridges the gap.

    当无法直接观察时，设计师会用模拟来共情。福特用“怀孕服”让男工程师体会孕妇开车的感受；MIT 的老化实验服能模拟 80 岁的视力和动作困难。沃尔沃做过“由女性为女性设计”的汽车；IDEO 甚至聘请过 91 岁的设计师专注老年人需求。最理想的当然是**用户自己设计**，因为洞察最深，但因为用户往往缺乏设计能力，所以模拟工具能弥补这一差距。

  * \[2025/9/4 19:13–19:18] **Air New Zealand Case: Skynest and Skycouch**
    Air New Zealand hired IDEO to reimagine long-haul economy flights. Through months of observation and prototyping, they introduced the “Skycouch” (three economy seats that convert into a couch) and later the “Skynest” (bunk-style sleeping pods). The insight: long flights frustrate families with kids and solo travelers alike, so giving flexibility for rest and play improves experience. This shows Design Thinking’s strength in human-centered service innovation.

    新西兰航空请 IDEO 重新设计长途经济舱体验。经过几个月的观察与原型测试，他们推出了“Skycouch”（三连座变沙发）和后来的“Skynest”（床铺式睡眠舱）。洞察是：长途飞行让带小孩的家庭和独行乘客都很痛苦，而提供灵活的休息与活动空间能大大改善体验。这就是设计思维在人本服务创新中的优势。

  * \[2025/9/4 19:18–19:22] **Observation Challenges: Lipsticks, Phones, and Culture**
    Not every product is easy to observe—lipstick use or toilet paper habits, for example. Here designers must rely on creative methods like self-reports, indirect cues, or simulations. Nokia once failed in Japan because they designed phones in Europe, unaware that Japanese youth wore their phones on neck straps—changing form factor needs completely. The moral: *observation is not for its own sake—it’s to uncover pain points that only real users, in real contexts, reveal.*

    并不是所有产品都容易观察，比如口红的使用方式或厕纸的习惯。这时设计师需要依靠创意方法，如自我记录、间接线索或模拟。诺基亚曾在日本失败过，因为他们在欧洲设计手机，却没注意到日本年轻人常把手机挂在脖子上，这完全改变了外形需求。总结是：**观察不是为了观察本身，而是为了发现只有真实用户、真实情境下才会暴露的痛点**。
  * \[2025/9/4 19:22–19:27] **Why Human-Centered Design Emerged Late**
    Until recently, most systems valued efficiency above all. That’s why old hospitals, offices, and even government services looked cold and purely functional. Today, Design Thinking pushes us to consider *human needs*, including emotions and unspoken expectations. In Singapore, for example, earlier public services emphasized speed and throughput. Now, redesigns also ask: how do users feel? Do they feel respected, comfortable, and empowered? That’s the shift.

    直到近几年，大多数系统的核心都是**效率优先**。因此早期的医院、办公室、甚至政府服务，看起来都冷冰冰、只讲功能。而设计思维提醒我们要考虑**人的需求**，包括情绪和未说出口的期待。在新加坡，早期的公共服务只强调快和量，现在的改造则会问：用户的感受如何？他们是否觉得被尊重、被照顾、能掌控体验？这就是转变。

  * \[2025/9/4 19:27–19:31] **Environment Shapes Interaction**
    Compare different campus layouts: compact high-rise blocks are efficient, but they limit chance encounters. Open, low-rise layouts with cafes and study areas, like in UTown, naturally spark collaboration. This is why canteens and cafes are central to a good learning environment—they create informal meeting spots where knowledge sharing and new ideas emerge. Good design isn’t just about space, it’s about *enabling people to connect*.

    比较不同的校园布局：紧凑的高层楼效率高，但减少了偶遇和交流的机会。开放式、低层的布局，比如 UTown，有咖啡馆和学习区，更容易激发合作。这就是为什么食堂和咖啡馆是好的学习环境的核心——它们提供了非正式的交流空间，知识分享和新点子就在这里产生。好的设计不仅关乎空间，还关乎**让人们更容易连接**。

  * \[2025/9/4 19:31–19:35] **Design for Interaction: One-North and Airports**
    One-North was built with an industrial “maximize space” mindset, but that discouraged social encounters. Later renovations even adjusted escalator flows to increase chances of bumping into others. Airports show the same lesson: user-centered design ensures people can find check-in counters quickly, preventing confusion and chaos. Both cases underline that efficiency and *usability* must go hand in hand.

    One-North 最初是以工业区“最大化空间”的思路建造的，但结果抑制了交流。后来翻新时甚至调整了扶梯方向，让人们更容易偶遇。机场也说明了同样的道理：以用户为中心的设计能让旅客快速找到值机柜台，避免混乱。这些案例强调：**效率与可用性必须并行**。

  * \[2025/9/4 19:35–19:41] **IDEO and Observation Frameworks (AEIOU)**
    IDEO’s strength lies in observing users carefully. Surveys and interviews alone are limited—people may not express or even know their pain points. Observation captures what they *do*, not just what they *say*. The AEIOU framework guides this: look at Actions, Environment, Interactions, Objects, and Users. By organizing field notes this way, designers spot hidden struggles and opportunities. That’s why IDEO excels not in any single technology, but in systematically applying this process across industries.

    IDEO 的强项在于细致的用户观察。单靠问卷或访谈是有限的——用户可能不会表达，甚至自己都没意识到痛点。观察记录的是**行为**，而不仅是**口头**。AEIOU 框架帮助我们梳理：动作 (Actions)、环境 (Environment)、互动 (Interactions)、物件 (Objects)、用户 (Users)。用这种方式整理现场记录，设计师能发现隐藏的困难和机会。这就是为什么 IDEO 的优势不是某项技术，而是**跨领域系统化应用过程**。

  * \[2025/9/4 19:41–19:47] **The Power of Process and Methodology**
    Mastering a method gives confidence. Whether in IDEO’s design work, in HR hiring, or in manufacturing with statistical process control—the principle is the same: consistent process produces consistent results. In research too, since no one knows the “right answer” at the frontier, methodology is the only way to judge credibility. A weak process may give a correct answer by chance, but only a strong process can *reliably* produce quality outcomes.

    掌握方法能带来信心。无论是 IDEO 的设计工作、人力资源的招聘，还是制造业的统计过程控制，道理都一样：稳定的过程，才能带来稳定的结果。在科研中更是如此：前沿问题没有“正确答案”，所以唯一能评判可信度的就是**研究方法**。差的过程偶尔也可能碰巧对，但只有强的过程才能**持续产出可靠成果**。

  * \[2025/9/4 19:47–19:54] **Empathy Through Simulation and Extreme Users**
    Sometimes direct observation is hard—like designing for pregnancy or old age. That’s why Ford used a pregnancy suit and MIT used aging suits to let designers feel real constraints. Similarly, engaging *extreme users* (like elderly or very young users) exposes edge-case needs that improve design for everyone. The principle: if you can’t observe, simulate; if you can’t generalize, study the extremes.

    有时直接观察很难，比如孕妇或老年人的体验。这时就需要模拟：福特的孕妇服、MIT 的老化服，让设计师亲身感受限制。同样，研究**极端用户**（如老人或儿童），能揭示边缘需求，从而改善所有人的设计。原则是：**不能观察，就去模拟；不能泛化，就研究极端**。

  * \[2025/9/4 19:54–20:00] **From Services to Products: Air New Zealand and Beyond**
    IDEO’s work with Air New Zealand shows how Design Thinking transforms services. Skycouch and Skynest emerged from months of ethnographic research and prototyping. The key was empathy: long flights are exhausting, especially for families. By reframing the problem from “more seats” to “better experience,” they created unique, human-centered solutions.

    IDEO 与新西兰航空的合作展示了设计思维如何改变服务。Skycouch 和 Skynest 的出现，源于几个月的人种学研究和原型实验。核心在于**共情**：长途飞行令人疲惫，尤其是家庭旅客。通过把问题从“多安排座位”转为“改善体验”，他们设计出独特的人本方案。

  * \[2025/9/4 20:00–20:09] **Media Richness: Why Pictures and Face-to-Face Matter**
    Designers often take photos and videos during observation. Why? Because pictures capture context that words miss. Rich media—tone, body language, visuals—reduce ambiguity. Media Richness Theory says: the more uncertain and ambiguous the situation, the richer the communication needed. For Design Thinking, which tackles messy human problems, face-to-face and visual evidence are crucial. Lean media (like email) works only for simple, unambiguous information.

    设计师在观察时常拍照录像。为什么？因为图片能捕捉文字遗漏的情境。**媒体丰富性理论**指出：情况越模糊、越不确定，就越需要丰富的沟通方式。设计思维处理的是复杂的人类问题，所以面对面交流、视觉证据至关重要。精简媒介（如电邮）只适合明确、单一的信息。

  * \[2025/9/4 20:09–20:22] **Final Examples: Limits of Self-Report and Cultural Nuances**
    Users rarely admit inconvenient truths—like a child misbehaving in a shopping cart. Observation reveals what words hide. Similarly, culture shapes use: Nokia’s failure in Japan (ignoring the “phone-on-a-strap” habit) showed the danger of designing without local observation. The closing lesson is simple: *Design Thinking thrives on empathy, observation, and iteration*. By grounding in real human contexts, it avoids solving the wrong problem and builds solutions people actually value.

    用户很少会承认不方便的事实——比如孩子在超市推车里乱跳。观察能揭示语言掩盖的真实。同样，文化也影响使用方式：诺基亚在日本失败，就是因为忽视了“挂脖子手机”的习惯。这些案例的结论很简单：**设计思维依赖于共情、观察与迭代**。只有扎根真实的人类情境，才能避免解决“假问题”，并创造真正被用户重视的方案。
## Week 5 Topic 6 Problem Definition 09.11
  * [19:08–19:10] **Context, SMART problem statements, and relevance**
    In DMAIC, the Define stage always starts with context: the company background, the industry, customer complaints, and so on. This is to make sure that the problem we are trying to solve is actually relevant to the organisation’s real situation. In other words, we must “solve the right problem”, not just “solve the problem right”. Being specific and time-bound is crucial: for example, “reduce complaints by 20% within one year” is very different from “reduce complaints by 20% within five years”. This is the logic behind the SMART framework for problem statements: being specific, measurable, achievable, relevant to the broader context, and time-bound.

    在 DMAIC 里，Define 阶段一开始一定要交代清楚背景：公司是谁、在哪个行业、客户在抱怨什么等等。这样才能确保我们要解决的问题，真的是企业目前面临的“对的问题”，而不是随便挑一个问题来做。换句话说，要“解决正确的问题”，而不是只把“手上的问题做得很漂亮”。这里时间维度特别重要，比如“一年内投诉减少 20%”和“五年内投诉减少 20%”就是完全不一样的目标。这也是为什么我们要用 SMART 框架：问题陈述要具体、可度量、可实现、与大目标相关，而且有清晰的时间界限。

  * [19:09–19:10] **Understanding the owner and context behind the problem**
    Conn and McLean, in *Bulletproof Problem Solving*, remind us that when we define a problem we should always ask: who is asking us to solve this problem, and from what perspective? If we know the key decision maker or “problem owner” well enough, we can infer what they care about, even if it is not explicitly written in the problem statement. Many issues are embedded in a larger, often unwritten, context. So if the written problem statement is brief or incomplete, a good problem solver will still be able to guess or deduce what the owner truly wants but did not say, forgot to mention, or is reluctant to mention. This is why understanding the decision makers and the organisational context is so important.

    Conn 和 McLean 在《Bulletproof Problem Solving》里强调：定义问题时，首先要搞清楚“是谁”要你解决这个问题，以及“他从什么角度”看这个问题。如果你足够了解这个关键决策者（问题的 owner），就可以推断出他真正关心什么，即使这些点没有写在问题陈述里。很多问题其实都嵌在更大的、没有写出来的情境之中。所以，当问题陈述很短、不完整的时候，一个好的问题解决者仍然能够根据对人的理解，推断出对方真正想要但没写出来、忘了写、或不方便写的东西。这就是为什么要理解决策者和组织情境。

  * [19:10–19:12] **Design thinking, empathy, and uncovering the “real” problem**
    This is similar to the “double diamond” in Design Thinking. In the first diamond, we do not just accept the problem statement at face value; we empathise, explore, and sometimes reframe the problem. The client or boss may give you a formal problem statement, but the real underlying issue may be deeper or slightly different. A good problem solver helps uncover the true problem the client wants to solve. The lecturer uses a doctor analogy: when a patient comes in and says “I am unwell here”, a good doctor will not just take those words literally and prescribe medicine immediately. Instead, the doctor asks more questions and investigates to find out whether there is a bigger or different illness behind the symptom. As consultants or problem solvers, if we simply take the boss’s statement and work on it without exploration, we are like a bad doctor who only treats the symptom.

    这一点和设计思维里的“双钻石模型”很像。第一个钻石强调，不要只照单全收地接受问题陈述，而是要去共情、探索，有时候还要重新界定问题。老板或客户给你的，只是一个表面的 problem statement，真正的根本问题可能更深、也可能有点不一样。好的问题解决者，要帮助对方把这个“真正的问题”挖出来。老师用医生做比喻：病人走进来只会说“我这里不舒服”，好的医生不会直接按病人原话开药，而是要问更多问题、做检查，看看背后是不是有更严重或不同的疾病。作为顾问或问题解决者，如果我们只是照老板写下来的话做事、不去探索、不去验证，那就像只治表面症状的“坏医生”。

  * [19:12–19:13] **Knowing your boundaries as a problem solver**
    At the same time, we must recognise boundaries. Sometimes, the root cause lies in something far beyond our scope. For example, a doctor may discover that a patient’s chronic illness is due to poor living conditions. The doctor can point this out, but cannot personally change the patient’s housing situation. In the same way, as problem solvers, we should be honest about what is within our control and what is not. We can diagnose and explain the broader causes, but we also have to state clearly where our responsibility and capability end.

    同时，我们也要清楚自己的边界。有些根本原因，明显超出了我们能干预的范围。比如，医生可能发现病人的慢性病其实来自很差的居住环境。医生可以把这个原因说出来，但不可能亲自帮病人搬家或重建房子。同样地，作为问题解决者，我们要诚实地区分：哪些是我们可以控制、可以行动的部分，哪些是超出我们职责和能力范围的。我们可以说明更大的成因，但也要清楚地画出“我能做到哪里”。

  * [19:13–19:15] **Success criteria and describing the “to-be” state**
    Another key part of problem definition is clarifying how the decision maker will judge success. This is where SMART criteria become very practical. During the Define stage, it is our job to elicit the success measures that are linked to the problem statement. One useful question to ask your boss or client is: “Five years from now, if this problem has been successfully solved, what do you see?” This forces the owner to describe the “to-be” state, similar to the “to-be process” in BPR. Once they describe that future state, we can check: is it specific, measurable, realistic, and time-bound? This helps both sides align on what “success” actually looks like.

    问题定义的另一关键点，是弄清楚决策者会用什么标准来判断“你有没有把问题解决好”。这里 SMART 的思路就非常实用。在 Define 阶段，我们要主动把这些和问题陈述相关的成功指标“问”出来。一个很好用的问题是：
    “如果五年后这个问题已经解决了，你看到的情况是什么样？”
    这个问题会逼着老板或客户把“未来的理想状态”（to-be state）说出来，很像我们在 BPR 里画的 to-be 流程。有了这个描述，我们就可以检查：它是否具体、可度量、现实、时间明确？这样双方对“什么叫成功”才真正对齐。

  * [19:15–19:17] **From “improve profit” to issue trees and smaller problems**
    The theme park example illustrates this. Suppose a theme park owner tells you: “I need to improve my profit, and you have one month.” Most people will immediately jump to random solutions. A better approach is to first refine the problem (for example, “improve profit by X% in one year”), and then break it down using an issue tree. “Profit” itself is a very big issue, so we decompose it into smaller, more manageable issues—such as revenue and cost, and then further into ticket revenue, merchandise, food and beverages, fixed costs, variable costs, and so on. The idea is that if we solve the right sub-issues, we will move the overall profit significantly. The issue tree becomes our diagnostic lens: it gives us a structured way to see which levers matter most and where to focus our effort.

    主题公园的例子就是一个很好的说明。假设园区老板跟你说：“我要提高利润，你有一个月时间。”大多数人的第一反应，都是随便想一些零散方案。更好的做法是：先把问题细化（例如“一年内利润提升 X%”），然后用 issue tree 把它拆开。“利润”本身是一个很大的问题，我们要把它拆成更小、更好分析的问题——比如先拆成收入和成本，再往下分成门票、周边商品、餐饮、固定成本、变动成本等等。核心思想是：只要抓到合适的子问题并解决，整体利润的指标就会被明显“带动”。Issue tree 就像一副诊断用的“眼镜”，帮我们有条理地看清哪些杠杆最关键、精力该花在哪些地方。
  * [19:17–19:18] **MECE and logical breakdown**
    When constructing an issue tree, one common guideline is the MECE principle—Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. “Mutually exclusive” means each branch should be distinct and not overlap; “collectively exhaustive” means all branches together should cover every possibility under that category. For example, when breaking down “cost”, splitting into fixed cost and variable cost is MECE: a cost cannot be both fixed and variable at the same time, and all costs must fall into one of the two. MECE helps impose logic, avoid double-counting, and ensure that the breakdown is complete.

    在做 issue tree 时，一个常用的原则是 MECE：相互独立、完全穷尽。“相互独立”表示各分支之间不能重叠；“完全穷尽”表示这些分支加起来必须把这个类别下所有可能性都包含进去。比如拆解“成本”时，分成固定成本与变动成本就是典型的 MECE：一个成本不可能同时既是固定又是变动，而所有成本都能归入这两类之一。MECE 的意义就在于让拆分更有逻辑、不重叠，也不会遗漏重要部分。

  * [19:18–19:20] **Applying MECE to revenue and cost**
    Using MECE, costs can be split into fixed (e.g., land lease, permanent staff) and variable (e.g., utilities, part-time staff, usage-based maintenance). Some items require judgment—maintenance, for instance, may include a fixed component and a usage-based component. For revenue, we can divide by categories such as ticket sales, merchandise, food and beverage, annual passes, etc. As long as categories do not overlap and jointly cover all revenue sources, the exact grouping is flexible. Binary splits are helpful but not mandatory; consultants focus more on logic than on forcing a strict binary.

    按 MECE 来拆分，成本可以分成固定成本（如场地租金、正式员工）和变动成本（如水电费、临时工工资、依使用量而定的维护费用）。有些项目需要判断——例如维护费用，有固定部分，也有按使用次数的部分。收入则可以按门票、周边商品、餐饮、年票等类别拆开。只要不重叠、能覆盖所有收入来源，分法可以很灵活。二元拆法常见但不是硬性要求；顾问更看重逻辑完整性，而非一定要二分。

  * [19:20–19:22] **Why “Others” is discouraged**
    Creating an “Others” category is allowed but discouraged. It signals incomplete thinking and tempts people to dump unclear items into it, defeating the diagnostic purpose of an issue tree. An issue tree is meant to open the black box, not create new black boxes. If “Others” becomes large or vague, the tree stops being useful.

    虽然技术上允许设立“其他”这一类，但一般不鼓励。因为这代表拆分不够完整，也很容易把不清楚或懒得想的项目丢进去，等于把“黑箱”重新装了回来，违背 issue tree 的目的。如果“其他”太大或太模糊，这棵树的诊断价值就会大幅下降。

  * [19:22–19:23] **Avoiding unnecessary depth (“don’t boil the ocean”)**
    Consultants often say “don’t boil the ocean”, meaning don’t expand the tree endlessly. Three to four levels of depth are usually enough. The appropriate depth depends on the context: in medical or safety contexts, precision matters a lot; in business contexts, approximations may be acceptable. The key is: the deeper breakdown must meaningfully help identify levers that influence the main issue.

    顾问常说“不要把整片海都煮沸”，意思是拆分不需要无限细。通常三到四层就够了。拆到什么程度要看情境：医学或安全相关的议题需要很高精度；商业问题则可能允许一些近似。核心是：继续往下拆是否能帮助我们找到真正影响主问题的关键杠杆。

  * [19:23–19:24] **Mathematical relationships inside issue trees**
    An issue tree is not just a list—it reflects mathematical relationships. Profit = Revenue – Cost; Ticket Revenue = Ticket Price × Number of Visitors; Total Merchandise Revenue = average spend × number of buyers × number of visitors. By structuring an issue tree according to these relationships, we can later estimate which levers have the biggest impact. This makes the analysis both logical and quantifiable.

    Issue tree 不是简单的分类清单，它隐含了数学关系。例如：利润＝收入－成本；门票收入＝票价×来客数；周边收入＝人均消费×购买人数比例×来客数。用这些数学关系结构化 issue tree，可以让我们后续更容易估算哪一个杠杆最能带来影响，使分析既有逻辑性也可量化。

  * [19:24–19:25] **Applying the tree: fixed vs variable cost examples**
    For fixed cost in a theme park, examples include land rental and full-time staff salaries. For variable cost, examples include part-time staff wages and condition-based maintenance. Some items have both fixed and variable components, so judgment is required. The goal is not perfect classification but a logical structure for diagnosis.

    在主题公园例子里，固定成本包括土地租金、正式员工薪水。变动成本包括兼职工资、依使用情况决定的维护费用。有些项目同时具备固定与变动成分，因此需要判断。目的不是分类“绝对正确”，而是提供合理的诊断结构。

  * [19:25–19:27] **The issue tree as a diagnostic tool**
    After constructing the tree, you still have not solved anything. What you have built is a diagnostic lens—a structured way to inspect reality. With the lens, you now gather data: visitor numbers, capacity limits, competitor prices, merchandise variety, food policies, etc. The lens helps identify which branches appear promising and which are irrelevant or impossible due to constraints such as capacity, contracts, or market competition.

    当 issue tree 画完时，你实际上还没有解决任何问题。你建造的是一副“诊断用的镜头”，用来检查真实世界的数据。有了这副镜头，你会去收集资料：来客数、容量上限、同行价格、周边商品种类、餐饮政策等等。这个镜头能帮助你判断：哪些分支有潜力、哪些因为容量、合约或市场竞争而不可能改变。

  * [19:27–19:29] **Identifying feasible and impactful branches**
    Using the tree, you may find: visitor numbers cannot increase due to safety limits; ticket prices cannot rise because competitors would take customers; merchandise has low variety compared to competitors; and food revenue is low due to allowing outside food. This analysis highlights which sub-issues are feasible and impactful. The goal is to “move the needle”—choose items where changes produce meaningful results.

    利用 issue tree，你可能得到这些判断：来客数因安全上限无法提升；票价因竞争者存在而无法上涨；周边商品比竞争者单调，这里有潜力；餐饮收入低是因为允许外带食物。分析这些点后，就能找出既可行又有影响力的子问题。核心是“move the needle”——选那些能带来实质变化的杠杆。

  * [19:29–19:30] **Time horizon influences what is feasible**
    A key insight: the time frame in the SMART problem statement affects which branches matter. If the boss wants profit improvement within one year, long-term levers like renegotiating a 20-year land lease are irrelevant. For short time horizons, only branches with short implementation cycles should be considered.

    一个关键洞察是：SMART 里定义的时间范围，会影响哪些分支真正“有意义”。如果老板要你在一年内提升利润，那像“重新谈判 20 年土地租约”这种长期杠杆就完全不相关。短期目标需要选择短周期、能快速落实的分支。
  * [19:30–19:32] **Filtering low-impact branches (“don’t work on small potatoes”)**
    After identifying feasible branches, the next step is to judge impact. Some branches may be technically solvable but contribute very little—such as reducing slightly above-market part-time wages, which may barely affect total cost. These are “small potatoes” and should not consume resources unless all high-impact levers have been exhausted. The aim is always to concentrate effort where solving a sub-issue meaningfully improves the main metric (profit, in this case).

    在筛选可行分支之后，下一步是判断“影响力”。有些分支虽然能做，但对整体几乎没有提升，例如兼职工资稍微偏高的问题，即使调整也不会显著降低总成本。这类属于“小土豆”，在高影响杠杆还没尝试前，不应该耗费资源。目标始终是把精力放在真正能显著改善主指标（这例子中是利润）的地方。

  * [19:32–19:34] **If the impact is unclear, the issue tree may need refinement**
    Sometimes you cannot estimate the effect of a branch because the logical link between the sub-issue and the main problem is unclear. This uncertainty is often a sign that the issue tree is not well-structured or not sufficiently MECE. A good issue tree produces branches where:
    (1) you know what data to check,
    (2) you can estimate impact, and
    (3) solving it clearly moves the main metric.
    If these conditions are not met, you may need to revise the tree.

    有时你无法判断某个分支的影响力，是因为这个分支和主问题之间的逻辑联系本来就不清楚。这往往意味着 issue tree 结构不够好，或不够 MECE。好的 issue tree 应该让每个分支都具备：(1) 你知道要查什么数据；(2) 能估算影响；(3) 解决后与主指标的提升有明确关系。如果做不到，就要回去改树。

  * [19:34–19:35] **Refining the problem into specific, solvable sub-problems**
    Once high-impact branches are identified, the big question (“How to improve profit?”) transforms into much smaller, concrete questions such as:
    • “How to increase merchandise revenue?”
    • “How to increase F&B revenue?”
    These can be tackled through brainstorming, benchmarking, data collection, and creative solution generation. At this stage, solutions become far more specific—adding product lines, redesigning menus, adjusting policies, etc.—and no longer rely on vague, high-level ideas.

    一旦确认哪些分支影响最大，“怎么提升利润？”这个大问题就被转化成具体小问题，例如：
    • “怎么提高周边商品的收入？”
    • “怎么提高餐饮收入？”
    这类问题可以用头脑风暴、标杆比较、数据分析等方式更具体地解决。此时的解决方案会变得非常明确，例如增加商品品类、改菜单、调整园区政策等，而不再是笼统的大想法。

  * [19:35–19:36] **Quantifying solution impact using the tree’s mathematical structure**
    Because the issue tree is built on mathematical relationships, we can forecast how each solution changes the main metric. For example:
    • If visitor numbers are known,
    • and we estimate what percentage will buy merchandise,
    • and their average spend,
    then we can calculate the expected revenue lift.
    Similarly for F&B: percentage of visitors who eat inside × average meal spend.
    This quantification turns ideas into evidence-based projections.

    因为 issue tree 的结构基于数学关系，我们能够估算每个方案对主指标的影响。例如：
    • 已知来客数，
    • 我们可以估算其中有多少比例会购买周边，
    • 人均消费是多少，
    那么就能算出预期的周边收入提升。
    餐饮同理：园区内用餐比例 × 平均餐费。
    这样的量化让方案从“想法”变成有证据支持的预测。

  * [19:36–19:37] **Selecting paths that clearly move the main metric**
    After quantifying solution impact, you can see which paths drive profit most effectively. For example:
    • Visitor numbers cannot increase → ignore this branch.
    • Ticket price cannot rise → ignore this too.
    • Merchandise variety and F&B policies can change → these become priority.
    The core idea: trace the link from small sub-problem → intermediate variable → main metric. A solution is valuable only if this chain is clear and significant.

    当方案的影响被量化后，就能看出哪些路径最能推动利润：
    • 来客数无法提升 → 排除；
    • 票价无法提高 → 排除；
    • 周边商品、餐饮政策可调整 → 优先处理。
    核心思想是：从“小问题 → 中间变量 → 主指标”这条路径必须清晰且影响大，这种方案才值得投入。

  * [19:37–19:38] **Avoid random brainstorming; use structured diagnosis**
    Most people faced with “improve profit” jump directly to random solution suggestions. Without an issue tree, they cannot justify which idea matters more, nor estimate the impact. Good problem solving requires first decomposing the big problem logically, then choosing smaller problems to solve. Only after that should brainstorming begin, ensuring ideas are grounded in logic instead of guesswork.

    多数人听到“提高利润”就立刻乱想方案。但没有 issue tree，他们无法判断哪个方案更重要，也无法估算影响力。好的问题解决流程是：先把大问题逻辑拆解，再挑选关键小问题，最后才进入头脑风暴。这样提出的方案才不是瞎猜，而是有结构、有根据的。

  * [19:38–19:39] **When the system is more complex than the simple profit example**
    The theme park example is simple: a mostly stable environment, steady demand, predictable competitors, etc. In real life, conditions may be dynamic—new competitors, shifting customer preferences, regulatory changes, etc. In such cases, the issue tree is still useful, but the lens must be adapted to a dynamic context. Some branches may require time-based modeling or scenario analysis.

    主题公园的例子相对简单：需求稳定、竞争格局明确、环境变化不大。真实情况可能复杂得多——竞争者增多、顾客偏好改变、法规变化等等。在这些情况下，issue tree 仍然有用，但这副“镜头”必须适应动态环境。有些分支可能需要时间序列分析或情景模拟。

  * [19:39–19:40] **Example of dynamic complexity: ticket types and customer segments**
    The lecturer gives the Disneyland example. Ticket revenue can be further subdivided into annual passes and daily tickets. During COVID, Disneyland adjusted strategy: reducing benefits for annual pass holders (who spend less on merchandise and F&B) and shifting toward daily visitors (who spend more). This is a strategic trade-off—fewer visitors but higher per-visitor spending. The issue tree helps expose these trade-offs, but decision makers must choose which segment to prioritise.

    老师举了迪士尼的例子。门票收入可以细分成年卡和日票两类。疫情期间迪士尼调整策略：降低年卡福利（因为年卡用户周边和餐饮消费低），转而吸引消费更高的日票游客。这里本质是一个战略取舍——要少一点顾客但更高消费，还是多一点顾客但消费更低？Issue tree 能帮助我们看到这些取舍，但真正的决策需要管理层自己选择优先方向。
  * [19:40–19:41] **The importance of making branches as mutually exclusive as possible**
    When a breakdown is not truly mutually exclusive, analytical problems arise. For example, if annual-pass holders and daily-ticket visitors overlap in spending categories, improving one branch might worsen another. This creates ambiguity. MECE is not about perfection, but about reducing overlap so the relationships stay traceable. If the branches are not clearly separated, a change in one sub-issue may inadvertently distort another, making diagnosis and forecasting unreliable.

    当分支并非真正互斥时，分析就会变得模糊。比如年卡用户与日票游客如果在消费类别上重叠，那改善一个分支可能会让另一个恶化，导致判断混乱。MECE 的目的不是追求完美，而是尽量减少重叠，让因果关系保持清晰。如果分支不够独立，一个子问题的改变可能无意中影响另一个，使诊断与预测都变得不可靠。

  * [19:41–19:42] **Trade-offs and strategy choices (QFD analogy)**
    Trade-offs exist in many decisions. Using the example of mobile phones, customers may want a big screen, long battery life, and a light phone body. Increasing screen size improves user experience but worsens weight and battery life. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) visualises these relationships using “+” (positive impact) and “–” (negative impact). The key challenge is to design creative solutions that improve one attribute *without* degrading others—this is what real innovation requires.

    许多决策中都存在取舍。以手机为例，消费者希望大屏幕、长续航、机身轻薄这三点同时满足。但屏幕变大往往会让机身更重、耗电更快。QFD（质量机能展开）会用 “+” 和 “–” 来显示这些相互影响。真正有挑战的是：设计出既能提升一个指标、又不损害其他指标的方案，这才是创新的本质。

  * [19:42–19:43] **Context boundaries and market equilibrium in strategic decisions**
    Whether a company targets high-spending customers or mass-market customers depends on contextual factors: number of competitors, market size, typical customer spending, and the firm’s own positioning. The lecturer emphasises that analysis must assume some equilibrium—price ranges, customer behaviours, and competitive dynamics cannot be shifting rapidly during the analysis period. If everything changes faster than you can diagnose, then the problem itself needs reframing.

    针对高端市场或大众市场的选择，取决于情境：竞争者数量、市场规模、顾客消费习惯、公司的定位等等。老师强调分析必须在一个“相对稳定”的环境假设下进行——价格区间、顾客行为、竞争状态在分析期内不能发生巨幅变化。如果这些外部因素变化比你诊断得还快，那问题本身就需要重新定义。

  * [19:43–19:44] **Frameworks do not change; data and environment do**
    The lecturer points out that a diagnostic framework (like an issue tree) remains valid even if real-world conditions shift. What changes are the values inside the tree—visitor numbers, spending behaviour, competitor pricing, cost structure. When the environment changes, you keep the same “lens” but update the inputs. Only if the fundamental logic of the problem changes do you revise the tree structure itself.

    老师强调：诊断框架（例如 issue tree）本身不会因环境变化而失效，变的是框架里的“数值”和“现实条件”，例如来客数、消费行为、竞争者价格、成本结构等。当外部环境变化时，你用同一副“镜头”，但更新新的输入数据。只有在问题的逻辑结构根本改变时，才需要重画整个树。

  * [19:44–19:45] **Top-down vs bottom-up issue tree construction**
    There are two ways to build an issue tree:
    • **Bottom-up:** Start from raw observations and extract a structure (the theme park example).
    • **Top-down:** Use existing frameworks such as Porter’s Five Forces, Fishbone Diagrams (Man, Machine, Method, Material), or PESTEL to guide the breakdown.
    Both are valid. Fishbone diagrams, for example, impose categories so that all possible causes in manufacturing problems are examined. The goal is the same: a complete, logical, non-overlapping breakdown that leaves “no stone unturned”.

    Issue tree 有两种构建方式：
    • **自下而上**：从具体观察出发，再总结结构（如主题公园例子）。
    • **自上而下**：直接套用现有框架，如波特五力、鱼骨图（人、机、料、法）、PESTEL 等。
    两者都可行。鱼骨图就是一种强制分类，用来确保制造业问题的所有可能原因都被检查过。目标是一致的：拆分要完整、有逻辑、不重叠，做到“无遗漏”。

  * [19:45–19:47] **Cognitive science: why our brains resist building issue trees**
    Humans prefer intuitive “fast thinking” because it consumes less energy. Building issue trees requires deliberate, structured reasoning, which is cognitively expensive. Our evolutionary history—where energy (food) was scarce—favoured brains that avoided unnecessary thinking. As a result, when faced with problems, most people jump straight to solutions instead of doing structured analysis. This is why good problem solvers must consciously override this instinct and train the “slow thinking” system.

    人类偏好直觉式的“快思考”，因为耗能低；构建 issue tree 则需要刻意、结构化的推理，消耗脑力。人类的进化史中，能量（食物）稀缺，大脑倾向节省思考。因此多数人遇到问题时会直接跳到方案，而不是先做结构分析。好的问题解决者必须刻意压制这种本能，训练自己的“慢思考”能力。

  * [19:47–19:48] **Why ChatGPT often cannot produce a correct MECE issue tree**
    The lecturer explains that large language models (LLMs) generate text through pattern prediction, not logic understanding. If the training data contains high-quality issue trees, models may reproduce something similar; if not, the output may look plausible but be illogical or non-MECE. Models do not inherently understand binary categories, exhaustive coverage, or logical dependencies. They only predict “what word is likely to come next”, not “what structure is correct”. Hence, LLM-generated issue trees often default to lists of solutions rather than logical decompositions.

    老师解释，大语言模型（LLM）是基于“模式预测”，而不是基于“逻辑理解”来生成文字。如果训练数据里恰好出现高质量的 issue tree，它可能模仿出来；如果没有，它就会给出貌似合理但逻辑混乱的拆分。模型不真正理解互斥、不重叠、因果结构这些概念。它唯一做的是预测“下一个词可能是什么”，而不是判断“什么结构是正确的”。因此，LLM 输出的 issue tree 往往变成解决方案清单，而不是逻辑拆解。

  * [19:48–19:49] **Why LLMs cannot guarantee MECE (technical limitation)**
    LLMs cannot verify whether a breakdown is logically exhaustive or exclusive because that requires reasoning beyond language patterns. Even if a model outputs an issue tree, it cannot ensure:
    • no overlap exists,
    • all possibilities are covered,
    • mathematical relationships are respected,
    • or that the decomposition aligns with business logic.
    Hence, MECE remains a *human* responsibility. LLMs may assist, but cannot replace structured human reasoning.

    LLM 无法确保一个拆分是 MECE 的，因为这类判断不是语言模式匹配，而是逻辑推理。即使模型生成了一棵 issue tree，也无法保证：
    • 不重叠，
    • 不遗漏，
    • 结构符合数学关系，
    • 拆法与实际业务逻辑一致。
    因此，MECE 仍然是“人的责任”。模型可以辅助，但不能取代人类的结构化分析。

  * [19:49–19:50] **ChatGPT’s output depends on training data, not true logic**
    If the training data contains many poor or non-MECE examples, the model will reproduce similarly flawed structures. If many solution-lists are labelled as “issue trees”, the model will believe that is what an issue tree looks like. The lecturer notes that ChatGPT can generate essays or summaries because these rely on pattern frequency, but cannot reliably generate MECE structures unless the training data contains them consistently.

    如果训练数据里大量“伪 issue tree”或不 MECE 的拆分被当成正确例子，模型就会学到那样的模式。如果许多解决方案清单被标注成“issue tree”，模型就会以为 issue tree 就是那种样子。老师指出，ChatGPT 能写文章、总结，是因为这些任务靠“语言模式频次”即可；但生成 MECE 拆分则需要稳定的结构逻辑，而训练数据不够一致时，模型就难以做到。
  * [19:50–19:52] **Example: applying process breakdown to QB House (haircut service)**
    The lecturer revisits the earlier QB House example. The core problem was reducing total haircut time. Using a *process-based* issue tree, we break the service into sequential stages:

    1. Booking
    2. Traveling to the shop
    3. Waiting
    4. Cutting
    5. Payment
    6. Leaving
       These stages are mutually exclusive (no overlap) and collectively exhaustive (cover the entire customer journey). Once structured, you can identify where most time is consumed—for instance, waiting time may be far longer than cutting time. Solutions should then target the major contributors, not the minor ones.

    老师再次举 QB House 的例子。核心问题是缩短整体理发时间。用“流程拆分”的 issue tree，我们将整个服务按顺序拆成：

    1. 预约
    2. 前往门店
    3. 等候
    4. 理发
    5. 付款
    6. 离开
       这些步骤互相独立（不重叠）且完全覆盖整个顾客旅程。结构出来后，就能判断时间主要花在哪里——例如等候时间可能远长于理发时间。那么方案就应该针对“主要耗时点”，而不是“次要耗时点”。

  * [19:52–19:53] **Solutions must map to specific process steps—not be generic**
    A common mistake is proposing a vague “app” to solve everything. Without a process breakdown, you cannot know which function the app should have or which part of the experience it truly improves. If you first identify that booking and payment are pain points, then an app that merges booking + queueing + payment makes sense. Structure first, solution second.

    常见错误是：随便说“做个 App 解决所有问题”。没有流程拆分，你根本不知道 App 需要什么功能，也不知道它究竟改善哪一段体验。如果先确认“预约”和“付款”是痛点，那么整合预约、排队、付款的 App 才有意义。先结构化，再谈方案。

  * [19:53–19:54] **Design Thinking connects with issue trees through user pain points**
    Design Thinking also decomposes user journeys to identify pain points. The sequence of steps (booking → traveling → waiting → cutting → paying) resembles a process-based issue tree. The difference is emphasis: issue trees focus on logic and completeness; Design Thinking focuses on empathy and user experience. Both frameworks align when diagnosing service problems.

    设计思维同样会把用户旅程拆分成步骤，找出痛点。（预约 → 前往 → 等候 → 理发 → 付款）这种拆法本质上和流程型 issue tree 很类似。区别在于侧重点不同：issue tree 强调逻辑与完整性；设计思维强调共情与体验。但在服务类问题中，两者其实高度一致。

  * [19:54–19:55] **Time horizon again changes solution design**
    Whether you choose long-term or short-term solutions depends on the target period. For example, if the theme park owner wants results within one year, “build a new restaurant” is too slow; “rent space to a fast-food chain” is immediately feasible. The same logic applies in service redesign—some ideas take years (changing physical layout), others are quick (digital queue system). SMART time constraints always matter.

    时间范围再次影响方案设计。例如主题公园案例中，如果老板要一年内见效，“自己开新餐厅”太慢；“租空间给快餐品牌”则立刻可行。同样地，在服务重新设计中，某些方案（改变动线）需多年，另一些（数字排队系统）很快能落地。SMART 的时间约束始终是关键因素。

  * [19:55–19:56] **Issue trees require equilibrium assumptions**
    When building an issue tree, we implicitly assume the system is stable enough for analysis—visitor numbers are not dropping unpredictably; competitor behaviour is not changing weekly. If such conditions change too fast, then the tree’s inputs must be updated, or the problem must be reframed. The diagnostic framework is stable, but its data must be refreshed regularly.

    构建 issue tree 时隐含假设系统处于相对稳定状态——来客量不会突然大幅变化，竞争者不会每周改变价格。如果外部条件变化太快，就要更新树中的数据，或重新界定问题。诊断框架本身稳定，但其中的数据必须持续更新。

  * [19:56–19:57] **Why people resist using issue trees (cognitive cost)**
    Humans prefer quick, intuitive responses (“fast thinking”) because structured reasoning demands effort. The lecturer cites Kahneman’s “Thinking, Fast and Slow”: our brains evolved to conserve energy, avoiding deep analysis unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, when confronted with a problem, people jump to “solutions I used last time” rather than analyse root causes. Good problem solvers must consciously adopt “slow thinking” to counter this instinct.

    人类更喜欢快速、直觉式反应（“快思维”），因为结构化推理需要更大的认知成本。老师引用 Kahneman 的《思考，快与慢》：我们的脑子为了省能量，在进化过程中形成了回避深度思考的倾向。所以面对问题时，人们更倾向于“上次这么做我又这么做”，而不愿重新分析根因。好的问题解决者必须主动转换到“慢思维”，抵抗这种惯性。

  * [19:57–19:58] **Complex problem-solving frameworks all share this structure**
    Issue trees, Design Thinking, DMAIC—they all force you to break open the black box, map relationships, and analyse systematically. They differ in terminology but share the same core logic:
    • don’t assume the first stated problem is the real problem,
    • structure the problem before solving it,
    • explore multiple branches systematically.
    This is why the lecturer shows that these frameworks converge despite appearing different.

    Issue tree、设计思维、DMAIC 本质上都做同一件事：把黑箱拆开、建立结构、系统分析。术语不同，但核心逻辑一致：
    • 不要以为对方讲的问题就是实际问题；
    • 在解决前先结构化；
    • 系统性探索多条分支。
    也因此，看似不同的方法论，其实在问题拆解逻辑上高度一致。

  * [19:58–20:00] **The “police search” metaphor: systematic, exhaustive scanning**
    The lecturer shows an image of police officers walking in a horizontal sweep line, scanning a field for evidence. This metaphor illustrates what an issue tree does: when you have *no idea* where the cause might be, you systematically examine every square inch. This requires discipline and resources, but ensures no important clue is missed. For problem-solving, this means:
    • sweep across all MECE branches;
    • test hypotheses branch by branch;
    • avoid prematurely jumping to conclusions.
    Structured analysis prevents blind spots.

    老师展示了一张警察横向排开、系统搜索现场的图片，来比喻 issue tree 的作用：当你完全不知道线索在哪里时，就要“地毯式”扫描每一寸地方。这需要纪律与资源，但能确保不漏掉关键证据。对应到问题解决，就是：
    • 沿着所有 MECE 分支逐一检查；
    • 一个分支一个分支地验证假设；
    • 避免过早下结论。
    有结构的分析能避免盲点。
  * [20:00–20:02] **Why diagnostic frameworks remain useful even when conditions shift**
    The lecturer emphasises that although external factors may change—visitor numbers fluctuate, ticket prices adjust, competitor strategies shift—the diagnostic *framework* still remains valid. The issue tree is like a magnifying glass: even if the object being examined changes shape, the magnifying glass still works. You simply use it again on the new conditions. The only time the framework must be redesigned is when the fundamental nature of the problem changes.

    老师强调，即使外部条件会变化——来客量可能波动、票价可能调整、竞争策略可能改变——诊断的“框架”依然有效。Issue tree 就像一块放大镜：即使你要观察的对象变形了，这块放大镜仍然好用，只需要重新照一次。只有当问题本质改变时，框架本身才需要重建。

  * [20:02–20:03] **Fast vs slow thinking: evolutionary explanation**
    The lecturer returns to cognitive science. Humans evolved to conserve energy because food was historically scarce. Our brains optimise for survival, not analytical problem-solving. Quick reactions (fight, flight, freeze) kept our ancestors alive. Slow, deliberate reasoning uses more energy, so our default mode is to avoid it. This explains why structured tools like issue trees feel “unnatural”, and why we tend to jump to simple, pattern-based answers.

    老师再次回到认知科学的角度。人类的进化目标是节省能量，因为过去食物稀缺。大脑优化的是“活下来”，而不是“做复杂推理”。快速反应（战斗、逃跑、僵住）能让祖先存活；慢速、有意识的推理更耗能，因此大脑天生抗拒。这就是为什么像 issue tree 这种结构化工具让人感觉“不自然”，以及为什么我们倾向于凭直觉、套模式来解决问题。

  * [20:03–20:05] **Why modern behaviour still follows ancient wiring**
    Even though food is now abundant, our brain circuitry has not evolved at the same pace. We still exhibit “energy-saving thinking”. This is why people often overeat highly processed food—the body’s “stop eating” signal evolved for slow-chewing foods, not modern fast-chew snacks. The lecturer uses this as an analogy: our cognitive habits were built for a different environment, so overcoming them requires awareness and deliberate practice.

    尽管现代社会食物充裕，我们的大脑线路却没有随之进化，所以仍然表现出“节能思维”。例如，人们容易因为快消化、高加工食品而吃过量，是因为身体早期进化出的“停止进食”信号原本是为“咀嚼很久的食物”设计的，而不是现代的“几秒吞下的零食”。老师借此类比：我们的认知习惯是为旧环境设计的，要克服它们需要刻意意识与练习。

  * [20:05–20:07] **Evolutionary constraints influence cognitive habits**
    Many cognitive biases—like avoiding deep thinking, relying on shortcuts, or jumping to conclusions—can be traced back to evolutionary constraints. Because mental effort historically consumed precious calories, humans evolved to minimise unnecessary thinking. This evolutionary mismatch explains why structured reasoning frameworks require conscious effort today, and why people often resist them unless trained.

    许多认知偏差，如逃避深度思考、依赖捷径、草率下结论，本质上与进化限制有关。因为深度思考过去会消耗宝贵能量，所以人类进化出尽量避免动脑的习性。这种“进化不匹配”也解释了为什么结构化推理框架需要强迫自己练习，以及为什么多数人在没训练的情况下都不愿使用这些框架。

  * [20:07–20:08] **Obesity analogy: biological lag vs modern environment**
    The lecturer cites research suggesting that obesity may partly stem from the mismatch between ancient biological design and modern food engineering. Historically, chewing took time, giving the body enough delay for “fullness” signals. Modern processed food reduces chewing time drastically, so people consume more before the signal arrives. This analogy reinforces the idea that our brains are similarly mismatched for modern problem-solving contexts.

    老师进一步引用有关肥胖的研究：肥胖的其中一个原因，是“旧的生物机制”跟“现代食品工业”的不匹配。过去吃东西要咀嚼很久，身体才有时间发出“饱了”的信号；现代加工食品让咀嚼时间变得极短，信号来不及出现，人们就吃多了。老师用这个类比说明：同样地，我们的大脑机制也跟现代问题解决的需求不匹配。

  * [20:08–20:09] **Structured problem-solving demands intentional effort**
    Because our instinct is to think fast and save energy, structured reasoning tools—like DMAIC, issue trees, or Design Thinking—require deliberate effort. Students often resist these methods not because they are difficult, but because they compete with natural instincts. The challenge is to build habits that override default thinking patterns.

    我们天生偏好快思考、省能量，因此结构化推理工具（如 DMAIC、issue tree、设计思维）都需要刻意练习。学生经常抗拒这些方法，并不是因为它们太难，而是因为它们违背了本能。真正的挑战是培养新习惯，让结构化思维覆盖掉原始的自动反应。

  * [20:09–20:10] **Summary before moving to the next topic**
    The lecturer signals a transition. The key message is that structured frameworks—issue trees, DMAIC, Design Thinking—are ways to systematise thinking so we do not rely on instinct alone. Even though they require effort, they allow us to tackle complex problems effectively. Understanding how our brains resist structured reasoning helps us better train ourselves to use these tools.

    老师在这里做段落小结，准备转入下一部分。核心信息是：结构化框架（issue tree、DMAIC、设计思维）让我们不再依赖直觉，而是能够系统解决复杂问题。虽然这些工具需要认知投入，但效果显著。理解大脑如何抗拒结构化思维，有助于我们有意识地训练这些能力。

  * [20:10–20:12] **Introducing the next activity: solving fall incidents in hospitals**
    Moving to the next topic, the lecturer sets up a group exercise: “How to prevent falls in hospital X?” Students are given 10 minutes to create an issue tree. They are reminded:
    • resist the instinct to jump to solutions,
    • build a MECE structure first,
    • rely on logic, not intuition,
    • use any tool—paper, laptop, PowerPoint’s hierarchy SmartArt.
    The point is to practise constructing a diagnostic lens before generating solutions.

    接下来老师引入新的课堂练习：“如何减少医院 X 的跌倒事故？”学生有 10 分钟画一棵 issue tree。老师提醒：
    • 抵抗直接想解决方案的冲动；
    • 先建立 MECE 的结构；
    • 靠逻辑，而不是直觉；
    • 可使用任何工具——纸、电脑、PowerPoint 的 SmartArt 层级图。
    目的就是练习先构建诊断镜头，再谈方案。
  * [20:12–20:14] **Understanding why different hospitals require different solutions**
    After the class begins the “falls in hospital” exercise, the lecturer clarifies an important point: even if two hospitals face the *same* problem (patient falls), the *root causes* may differ. One hospital’s falls may come from poor lighting; another’s from staff shortages; another’s from slippery flooring. The *symptom* is the same, but the *drivers* differ. Therefore, each context needs its own issue tree. A correct diagnostic lens must be generic enough to cover all possible causes, but flexible enough for each hospital to identify its unique contributors.

    当课堂开始做“医院跌倒问题”的练习时，老师强调一个关键点：即使两个医院面对相同的“跌倒”问题，根本原因也可能完全不同。有的医院是灯光不足、有的是员工不够、有的是地板湿滑。症状一样，但成因不同。因此每个情境都需要自己的 issue tree。一个好的诊断镜头要足够通用，能涵盖所有可能原因；又要足够灵活，让每家医院找到自己的独有成因。

  * [20:14–20:16] **Trying multiple lenses when the first issue tree fails**
    If the first issue tree does not yield clear insights, you change the lens. For example, a process breakdown may not work, so you shift to a people–equipment–environment framework. Or if you start with categories like “human / non-human causes” and find they are not MECE, you reorganise into process stages, physical conditions, or policy-related factors. This iterative refinement is normal. Good problem solvers test different decompositions until the relationships become clear.

    如果第一棵树没能提供有用洞察，那就换一个“镜头”。例如，流程拆分法不合适，就换成人员–设备–环境的角度；或如果开始用“人为／非人为”分类结果不 MECE，就改成流程、物理条件、政策因素等。这样的迭代很正常。优秀的问题解决者会尝试不同拆法，直到逻辑关系足够清晰。

  * [20:16–20:18] **ChatGPT’s output: why the model gives solutions instead of structure**
    The lecturer asks students to try prompting ChatGPT to produce a MECE tree for “causes of hospital falls”. The model returns a list of *solutions* instead of root causes. This shows that LLMs are trained on many “solution lists”, so they assume that when people talk about a problem, they want answers—not structure. This is why ChatGPT jumps to “install grab bars, train staff” instead of producing a proper issue tree. It lacks the logic to understand the difference between *diagnosis* and *intervention*.

    老师请学生用 ChatGPT 生成“医院跌倒原因的 MECE 拆分”，结果模型产出的是“解决方案列表”而不是拆因树。这说明 LLM 的训练数据中充满了“方案清单”，所以它误以为人们提问题就是要答案，而不是结构化诊断。模型无法真正理解“诊断”与“解决”的区别，因此会直接跳到“加扶手、培训员工”这种方案上。

  * [20:18–20:20] **Why ChatGPT cannot guarantee MECE even if you instruct it explicitly**
    Even if you tell ChatGPT “give me a MECE issue tree”, the output may still fail:
    • some branches overlap,
    • some categories are missing,
    • or the structure mixes causes and solutions.
    This is because the model relies on language frequency, not logical necessity. Unless MECE trees appear *consistently* in its training corpus, it cannot reliably reproduce them. The lecturer emphasises that structured decomposition is ultimately a thinking task—not a pattern-recognition task.

    即使你明确告诉 ChatGPT：“给我一棵 MECE 的问题树”，它输出的结构仍可能失败：
    • 分支互相重叠；
    • 某些类别缺失；
    • 原因和方案混在一起。
    这是因为模型依赖的是“语言出现频率”，而不是“逻辑必须如此”。除非训练语料中大量存在并统一呈现 MECE 树结构，否则模型无法稳定复现。老师强调：结构化拆解，归根结底是需要“思考”的任务，而不是“模式匹配”的任务。

  * [20:20–20:22] **Students reflect on the model’s mistakes**
    The lecturer asks students: “Are you satisfied with ChatGPT’s answer? Is it MECE?”
    Students conclude:
    • the model gives plausible words,
    • but not logically correct breakdowns,
    • and often jumps to popular or common-sense explanations,
    • reflecting repetition in its training data.
    This highlights the gap between *linguistic prediction* and *analytical reasoning*.

    老师问学生：“你们对 ChatGPT 的回答满意吗？它是 MECE 吗？”
    学生们的结论是：
    • 看起来好像有道理，
    • 但逻辑结构不对，
    • 经常套用大众常识，
    • 本质上是训练数据里重复出现的句式。
    这凸显了“语言预测”与“逻辑推理”的差异。

  * [20:22–20:24] **Why LLMs cannot truly reason (next-token prediction limitation)**
    The lecturer explains that large language models do not “understand logic”—they pick the next word with highest probability. If many poorly structured answers appear in the training data, the model will mimic them. If a logically incorrect but popular framing appears often, the model assumes it is correct. This is why ChatGPT can produce beautifully written text, but cannot guarantee structural correctness.

    老师进一步解释：大语言模型并不“理解逻辑”，它只是根据概率挑选最可能出现的下一个词。如果训练数据中大量存在结构差的答案，模型就会模仿；如果某种不合逻辑但很流行的说法频繁出现，模型也会以为那是正确的。这就是为什么 ChatGPT 能写得很流畅，却无法保证结构正确。

  * [20:24–20:26] **LLMs excel at language artifacts, but not structural decomposition**
    The lecturer notes:
    • Essays, summaries, explanations → rely on linguistic style → LLMs perform well.
    • MECE breakdowns, diagnostic frameworks → require logical hierarchy → LLMs struggle.
    Unless the training data explicitly contains clean, consistent trees, the model cannot “invent” logical structure from scratch. This distinction is crucial for students using AI in problem-solving.

    老师指出：
    • 写文章、做摘要、解释概念 → 主要靠语言风格 → LLM 做得很好；
    • 结构拆分、MECE 框架 → 需要严格的逻辑层级 → LLM 表现差。
    除非训练数据中有大量、统一、干净的树形拆分，否则模型无法凭空“构造”逻辑结构。学生在使用 AI 辅助解决问题时，必须理解这一点。

  * [20:26–20:28] **Issue trees must come from human reasoning, not AI output**
    The lecturer concludes this segment by stating that real problem-solving requires *human thinking*. AI can help generate ideas, but framing the problem, ensuring MECE, validating assumptions, and mapping logical relationships all require human judgment. Students should treat AI as an assistant, not a substitute for structured reasoning.

    老师在这一段最后总结：真正的解决问题仍依赖“人的思考”。AI 可以给点子，但构建问题框架、确保 MECE、验证假设、梳理逻辑关系，都必须靠人的判断。学生应该把 AI 当作辅助，而不是替代结构化思维的工具。

  * [20:28–20:30] **Returning to the hospital falls exercise**
    The lecturer reminds students to now produce their own MECE breakdown for hospital falls:
    • avoid solutions,
    • focus on categorising possible root causes,
    • verify independence between branches,
    • ensure completeness.
    Students are instructed to produce a draft quickly and refine it through iteration—mirroring real consulting practice.

    老师提醒学生回到“医院跌倒”练习，并再次强调：
    • 不要写方案，
    • 专注于归类可能的根因，
    • 确保分支互不重叠，
    • 覆盖全部范围。
    要求学生先快速画出草稿，再不断迭代，这正是咨询工作的真实方式。
  * [20:30–20:32] **The difficulty of achieving true MECE in real situations**
    The lecturer highlights that in many real-world service problems, causes do not neatly fall into clean, non-overlapping categories. Human factors, environmental factors, processes, and equipment frequently interact. For example, a fall may result from poor lighting (environment) interacting with staff distraction (human) and a patient walking unsupervised (process). MECE is an *ideal* to strive for, not a rigid rule. The goal is to reduce overlap as much as possible so relationships stay intelligible.

    老师指出，在真实的服务场景里，要做到完全 MECE 其实很难。人员因素、环境因素、流程因素、设备因素往往彼此交织。例如一次跌倒事件可能同时受灯光不足（环境）、员工分心（人员）、病人无人陪同行走（流程）等因素影响。MECE 是要努力追求的目标，而不是绝对要求。核心是尽可能减少重叠，让关系保持清晰可分析。

  * [20:32–20:34] **Trade-offs in decomposition depth: too shallow vs too detailed**
    If your breakdown is too shallow (e.g., only “environment / people / process”), it may not reveal actionable insight. But if it is too detailed (e.g., splitting lighting into 15 subtypes), you waste effort and lose strategic clarity. Consultants typically aim for 3–4 layers—deep enough to locate root causes, but shallow enough to maintain focus and avoid overwhelming complexity.

    老师强调，拆分太浅，例如只分成“环境／人员／流程”，可能无法提供可执行洞察；但拆得太细，例如灯光再拆成十五种类型，又会浪费精力、失去战略重点。咨询界通常追求三到四层结构——足够深找到根因，又不会让复杂度失控。

  * [20:34–20:36] **Example: examining falls using multiple possible lenses**
    The lecturer explains that depending on the situation, different hospitals may find different lenses more intuitive:
    • **Process lens:** admission → transfer → walking → toileting → night rounds
    • **Environmental lens:** lighting → flooring → bed rails → bathroom layout
    • **Human factors lens:** patient mobility → medication side effects → staff supervision
    • **Equipment lens:** wheelchairs, walkers, alarms
    All these can produce valid MECE structures if done logically. The challenge is choosing which lens reveals the most insight for a particular hospital.

    老师举例说明，不同医院可能会采用不同“镜头”来分析跌倒问题：
    • **流程镜头：**入院 → 转运 → 行走 → 如厕 → 夜间巡房
    • **环境镜头：**光线 → 地板 → 床栏 → 卫浴布局
    • **人员镜头：**病人行动能力 → 药物副作用 → 护士监管
    • **设备镜头：**轮椅、助行器、警报器
    这些只要逻辑清晰，都可能是有效的 MECE 结构。难点在于选择哪个镜头对某家医院最有洞察力。

  * [20:36–20:37] **Why solutions differ even when the root cause category is the same**
    Even within a single branch, two hospitals may still require different solutions. For example, under “environment → lighting”, one hospital may need brighter bulbs; another may need motion-sensor night lights; another may need to redesign corridor angles. MECE structures help identify *where* the problem sits, but the *solution* must still respect local context and constraints.

    即使属于同一个分支，两家医院的解决方案也会不同。例如在“环境 → 灯光”下，一家医院可能只需换更亮的灯泡；另一家需要装夜间感应灯；第三家可能要调整走廊角度。MECE 帮我们定位“问题在哪”，但“怎么解决”仍需根据现场情况决定。

  * [20:37–20:38] **Iteration: refining trees as new insights emerge**
    The lecturer emphasises that issue trees rarely come out perfect the first time. As you gather more data or understand more context, you refine the branches—removing redundant categories, redistributing sub-branches, or changing the top-level split entirely. Iteration is not a sign of weakness but a hallmark of rigorous problem-solving.

    老师强调，第一版 issue tree 很少是完美的。随着你获得更多数据或更理解情境，你会不断调整分支——删掉重复分类、重新分配子分支，甚至完全换掉顶层拆法。迭代不是失败，而是严谨问题解决的正常过程。

  * [20:38–20:40] **Preparing students to evaluate ChatGPT’s limits in their own projects**
    Before moving on, the lecturer reminds students that when using ChatGPT for their group projects (such as DMAIC, BPR, Design Thinking), they must critically evaluate AI-generated structures. AI can provide:
    • starting points,
    • brainstorming options,
    • text summarisation,
    • rewriting and polishing.
    But students must still verify:
    • whether the structure is MECE,
    • whether the decomposition aligns with project context,
    • whether assumptions are logical,
    • whether relationships are quantified correctly.
    The lecturer’s goal is to ensure students do not outsource the “thinking” part to AI.

    在继续之前，老师提醒学生：在自己的小组项目（DMAIC、BPR、设计思维等）中使用 ChatGPT 时，一定要批判性思考。AI 可以：
    • 提供起点，
    • 给出头脑风暴想法，
    • 做总结，
    • 帮忙润色。
    但学生必须亲自检查：
    • 结构是否 MECE，
    • 拆分是否符合项目情境，
    • 假设是否合理，
    • 逻辑关系是否量化正确。
    老师的目的，是避免学生把“思考的责任”外包给 AI。
  * [20:40–20:41] **ChatGPT’s limitations become clearer through prompting**
    The lecturer has students try additional prompts such as “Give me a MECE issue tree for hospital falls” or “Explain why your output is not MECE.”
    The results reveal a pattern:
    • ChatGPT often outputs reasonable-looking words,
    • but the structure is faulty,
    • sometimes mixing causes and solutions,
    • sometimes producing overlapping categories,
    • sometimes missing entire classes of causes.
    The exercise helps students understand that AI cannot autonomously ensure logical rigour.

    老师让学生尝试更多提示词，例如“给我一个医院跌倒事件的 MECE 拆分树”或“解释你的输出为何不 MECE”。
    结果呈现一个规律：
    • ChatGPT 看似说得通，
    • 但结构经常不对，
    • 会把原因和方案混在一起，
    • 会出现分支重叠，
    • 会漏掉整类成因。
    这练习让学生更清楚地看见：AI 并不能自动保证逻辑严谨性。

  * [20:41–20:43] **Why ChatGPT cannot reliably generate logical trees (technical reasoning)**
    ChatGPT is trained on “next-word prediction” from massive text corpora. It does not run logic checks, nor does it understand “exhaustive vs overlapping categories.” When it attempts to generate an issue tree, it merely imitates the *shape* of trees seen in training data. It cannot:
    • verify mutual exclusivity,
    • ensure full coverage,
    • infer mathematical relationships,
    • or adjust categories to match context.
    Without these capabilities, logically coherent MECE trees are beyond its native abilities.

    ChatGPT 的训练方式是“下一个词的预测”，基于庞大语料库。它不会进行逻辑检查，也不理解“是否互斥／是否穷尽”。当它尝试画 issue tree 时，只是在模仿训练数据中出现过的“外形”，无法：
    • 判断是否互斥，
    • 判断是否穷尽，
    • 推断数学关系，
    • 根据情境调整分类。
    因此，要它自主生成真正逻辑严谨的 MECE 树，本质上超出了它的原生能力。

  * [20:43–20:44] **Model outputs reflect writing frequency, not truth or logic**
    If certain explanations appear frequently online—even if incorrect—ChatGPT may replicate them because frequency influences prediction. Thus, the model sometimes produces confident but incorrect decompositions. This is why human verification is essential: AI can generate polished language but cannot guarantee the reasoning beneath it.

    如果某些错误的解释在网上频繁出现，即使它们不正确，ChatGPT 也可能照样复述，因为频率影响预测。因此模型有时会输出“很有自信但逻辑错误”的拆分。这就是为什么必须要有人类检查：AI 能生成流畅语言，但无法保证背后的推理正确。

  * [20:44–20:45] **Encouraging students to do hands-on construction of trees**
    The lecturer stresses that the skill of building issue trees requires practice:
    • starting from scratch,
    • reflecting on category choices,
    • evaluating overlap,
    • checking completeness,
    • iterating based on evidence.
    Students must engage mentally and cannot outsource this step to AI. The hands-on practice of drawing and revising issue trees is essential for developing structured thinking.

    老师强调，构建 issue tree 的能力必须靠亲自练习：
    • 从零开始画，
    • 反思分类方式是否合理，
    • 检查是否重叠，
    • 检查是否穷尽，
    • 根据证据不断迭代。
    这些都不能外包给 AI，必须靠人脑参与。实际画树、改树，是培养结构化思维的关键训练。

  * [20:45–20:46] **AI as an assistant, not a replacement for reasoning**
    The lecturer summarises that ChatGPT can assist in:
    • generating ideas,
    • producing summaries,
    • rewriting text,
    • providing examples.
    But for MECE logic, diagnosis, and decomposition, AI cannot be trusted to produce correct structures. Students should rely on their own analytical reasoning and use AI only as a supplementary tool.

    老师总结，ChatGPT 可以协助：
    • 出主意，
    • 做总结，
    • 改写文本，
    • 提供示例。
    但在 MECE 拆分、诊断、结构分析方面，AI 并不可靠。学生应该依靠自己的逻辑推理，AI 只能作为辅助手段。

  * [20:46–20:47] **Closing remarks and transition out of the session**
    The lecturer ends the segment by reminding students that in their upcoming assignments, the expectations are:
    • define the problem clearly,
    • construct logical issue trees,
    • check MECE rigorously,
    • avoid skipping straight to solutions,
    • refine problem statements iteratively.
    The class is reminded to sign attendance and prepare for the next session in two to three weeks.

    老师在结尾提醒学生，在即将到来的作业中要做到：
    • 清晰定义问题，
    • 构建逻辑合理的问题树，
    • 严格检查 MECE，
    • 避免跳过诊断直接想方案，
    • 多轮迭代问题陈述。
    并提醒同学签到，下次课将于两三周后继续。
## Week 6 Consulting in the Age of GenAI 09.18
  [18:06–18:12] **What consultants do and why consulting is a powerful career path**

  **English (refined)**
  Many well-known people have had consulting experience at some point in their careers. For example, Mitt Romney worked at Bain & Company, and Tim Cook worked mainly in operations roles at IBM and Apple, but gives off a very “consultant-like” impression even though he was never actually a consultant. The point is that consulting is not a lifelong label; it is usually a stage in a broader career.

  Many young people join consulting precisely because they are unsure what they want to do long term. Consulting exposes them to many industries, functions, and problems in a short time. After a few years, they often branch into very different paths: corporate leadership, startups, policy, technology, and so on. Consulting acts as a “career accelerator” and an option-expander.

  The speaker then shares several projects he personally worked on:

  1. **German national football team (World Cup 2014)**

     * While at SAP, he helped develop an analytics solution for the German national team.
     * The collaboration was only announced after Germany’s famous 7–1 win against Brazil in the semi-final.
     * After he left SAP, Germany was knocked out in the group stage in the next two World Cups – a tongue-in-cheek suggestion that the analytics might have mattered.

  2. **“Fitness Forecast” for New Zealand dairy cows**

     * A New Zealand dairy company wanted to improve milk quality.
     * They attached sensors to cows to track movement patterns (how often and where they moved).
     * The goal was to correlate movement behavior with milk quality and optimize farm practices.
     * Internally, they gave this project the playful name “Fitness Forecast.”

  3. **Relocation of Indonesia’s capital**

     * McKinsey helped the Indonesian government analyze and plan the move of the national capital to a new location.
     * They supported site selection and high-level planning, although they did not physically construct the city themselves.

  4. **New York prison analytics project**

     * McKinsey worked with a New York prison to reduce inmate violence.
     * They used analytics to decide how to group inmates (by crime type, background, etc.) to minimize conflict.
     * Initially, violence decreased, but after about two years, violence rose above the original level.
     * One key lesson: patterns and populations change over time; a static analytic rulebook cannot be used indefinitely without recalibration.

  These cases illustrate what consultants do: they work across growth, operations, strategy, technology, and organization problems, often applying data and analytics in very different domains.

  **中文翻译**
  很多知名人物在职业生涯的某个阶段都做过咨询。比如，Mitt Romney 曾在贝恩（Bain & Company）工作；Tim Cook 虽然主要在 IBM 和 Apple 做运营类岗位，从未正式当过顾问，但给人的感觉非常“顾问气质”。重点是：咨询通常不是一辈子的身份，而是职业旅程中的一个阶段。

  很多年轻人之所以进入咨询，是因为他们暂时还不知道自己未来想做什么。咨询可以在短时间内让他们接触到不同的行业、职能和问题。几年之后，他们往往会走向完全不同的道路，比如企业高管、创业、政策、技术等等。咨询更像是一种“职业加速器”和“选项放大器”。

  讲者接着分享了几段亲身参与的项目：

  1. **德国国家队——2014 世界杯**

     * 他在 SAP 工作时，为德国国家队开发过一套数据分析解决方案。
     * 合作直到德国 7:1 大胜巴西、打入决赛后才对外宣布。
     * 他离开 SAP 后，德国队在接下来两届世界杯都小组出局——这是半开玩笑地暗示：也许数据分析真的有用。

  2. **新西兰奶牛“Fitness Forecast（健康预测）”**

     * 一家新西兰乳业公司希望提升牛奶质量。
     * 他们给奶牛绑上传感器，记录其运动轨迹（多频、走多远、走到哪里）。
     * 目标是找出运动模式与奶质之间的相关性，从而优化牧场管理。
     * 项目内部起了一个很酷的名字，叫 “Fitness Forecast（健康预测）”。

  3. **印尼迁都项目**

     * 麦肯锡协助印尼政府分析并规划国家首都迁移的新地址。
     * 主要工作是选址和整体规划，具体建设不由咨询公司来做。

  4. **纽约监狱暴力事件分析项目**

     * 麦肯锡与纽约的一所监狱合作，希望降低囚犯之间的暴力事件。
     * 通过数据分析，设计不同囚犯的分组方式（按犯罪类型、背景等）以减少冲突。
     * 初期暴力事件的确下降，但两年后暴力率反而高于原来。
     * 关键教训：人群结构和环境会随时间变化，静态的分析结论不能无限期重复使用，必须定期校准。

  这些案例反映出顾问的工作范围非常广：增长、运营、战略、技术、组织都可能涉及，而且经常需要把数据与分析用在完全不同的场景里。

  [18:12–18:17] **Consultants as “business doctors” and consulting as a lifestyle**

  **English (refined)**
  If we try to summarize what consultants do, one helpful analogy is: **consultants are like doctors for organizations**.

  They:

  1. Diagnose problems through interviews, observation, data analysis, and reference cases.
  2. Provide an independent perspective that internal teams often cannot give.
  3. Design treatment plans (recommendations) and monitor key KPIs to adjust actions.
  4. Build deep expertise in specific industries or functions by repeatedly solving similar problems.
  5. Operate on a foundation of trust. Without trust, even the best recommendations will not be accepted.

  One reason companies hire consultants is precisely because they need independence. For instance, if a company needs to reduce headcount in HR, it is unrealistic to ask the HR team themselves to design who to fire. An external, trusted party is needed.

  Consulting is also a **lifestyle**, not just a job. The speaker shows his own travel statistics from 2018:

  * About 100 flights in a year.
  * Roughly 400 hours spent on planes.
  * Around 250 nights in hotels, enough to reach top-tier status in two hotel loyalty programs.

  This kind of travel schedule is exciting for younger consultants (especially those fresh from MBA), who enjoy seeing different countries and sometimes staying over weekends in project locations. But for someone with a young child and family responsibilities, that lifestyle becomes a serious trade-off and a reason to eventually leave consulting.

  **中文翻译**
  如果要总结顾问在做什么，一个很有用的比喻是：**顾问就像“企业的医生”**。

  他们会：

  1. 通过访谈、观察、数据分析和对标案例来“诊断”问题。
  2. 提供内部团队很难给出的、独立的第三方视角。
  3. 设计“治疗方案”（建议方案），并通过关键指标（KPI）来监测与调整行动。
  4. 在特定行业或职能上积累深厚经验，因为同类问题会反复出现。
  5. 把一切建立在“信任”之上，没有信任，再好的方案也落不了地。

  企业之所以请顾问，很大一部分原因就是需要这种独立性。比如，一个公司要裁 HR，自然不可能让 HR 自己设计裁谁；这时就需要一个被信任的外部角色来做这个工作。

  咨询也不仅是一份工作，更是一种**生活方式**。讲者展示了自己 2018 年的出差数据：

  * 一年大约飞行 100 次；
  * 在飞机上累积约 400 小时；
  * 在酒店过夜约 250 晚，足以在两家酒店集团都达到最高会员等级。

  这样的出差节奏对刚毕业、还很“年轻”和自由的顾问来说很有吸引力，可以频繁出国、周末顺便在项目国家玩一玩。但对于已经有小孩、需要顾及家庭的人来说，这种生活方式会变成很大的权衡，也可能是离开咨询的重要原因。

  [18:17–18:21] **MECE: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**

  **English (refined)**
  The first core micro-skill in consulting is **MECE**: *mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive*.

  * **Mutually exclusive**: Parallel buckets or ideas should not overlap.
  * **Collectively exhaustive**: Taken together, they should cover all relevant possibilities in that space.

  If a doctor gives you two overlapping diagnoses, or says “it might be one of many things, but we don’t know,” you cannot act. Similarly, if your categories miss important possibilities, you also cannot act effectively. Good problem structuring must be both clear and complete.

  The speaker shows a bad McKinsey chart about a theme park’s revenue breakdown. The categories include things like day tickets, annual passes, fast-track upgrades, events, etc.

  Problems:

  * Some categories overlap (e.g., fast-track upgrades could apply to different ticket types).
  * Some major revenue streams are missing (e.g., food and beverage).

  A better MECE structure is:

  1. Admissions (day tickets, annual passes, etc.)
  2. Food & beverage
  3. Sponsorships and events

  Each bucket is clean (non-overlapping), and together they cover the major revenue streams. Once the buckets are clear, you can then show how each revenue stream evolves over time and draw meaningful conclusions.

  **中文翻译**
  咨询中的第一个“微技能”是 **MECE 原则**：*相互独立（Mutually Exclusive），完全穷尽（Collectively Exhaustive）*。

  * **相互独立**：并列的分类或观点之间不应该重叠。
  * **完全穷尽**：合在一起应该把该空间内的重要可能性都覆盖到。

  如果医生给你两个互相重叠的诊断，或者说“可能很多种情况，但也说不清”，你就很难采取行动。同样，如果分类漏掉关键可能性，你也没办法做出有效决策。好的问题结构必须既“清晰”，又“完整”。

  讲者展示了一个关于主题乐园收入的“失败”麦肯锡图表。分类包括单日票、年票、快速通道升级、活动等。

  问题在于：

  * 类别之间有重叠（例如快速通道升级可以发生在不同票种上）；
  * 缺少重要收入来源（例如餐饮收入）。

  一个更符合 MECE 的结构是：

  1. 门票收入（单日票、年票等）；
  2. 餐饮收入；
  3. 赞助与活动收入。

  这三个大类之间不重叠，而且合在一起基本覆盖了主题乐园的主要收入来源。结构一旦清晰，就可以在其基础上展示各收入随时间的变化，从而得出有意义的结论。

  [18:21–18:27] **The Pyramid Principle and synthesizing insight**

  **English (refined)**
  The second core micro-skill is the **Pyramid Principle**.

  You can think of it as a pyramid:

  * At the top: a clear recommendation or main message.
  * Under it: 2–4 key supporting arguments.
  * Under each argument: evidence and analysis that back it up.

  Consultants use this structure in almost everything: thinking, emails, slides, and discussions. It’s also why many McKinsey consultants are “obsessed” with having three points. If there are more than three, they try to merge or prioritize until they get a clean 3-point storyline.

  There are two main ways to build the pyramid:

  1. **Bottom-up (from evidence to insight)**

     * Collect and organize all relevant facts, data, and observations.
     * Group them into MECE buckets.
     * Ask “So what?” to each group of evidence.
     * The “So what?” becomes your insight or sub-conclusion.

  2. **Top-down (from hypothesis to support)**

     * Start from a tentative recommendation or hypothesis.
     * Ask, “If this is true, what 2–3 things must also be true?”
     * These become your supporting arguments.
     * Then you collect data and analysis to test/support each one.

  Good synthesis is more than summarizing; it is the skill of turning scattered information into a convincing, logically structured argument that others can understand and accept.

  In communication, you can use the pyramid in two directions:

  * **Direct (top-down) communication**:

    * Start with the recommendation.
    * Then give 2–3 arguments.
    * Then show selected evidence.
    * This is suitable for senior stakeholders and decision-makers.

  * **Indirect (bottom-up) communication**:

    * Present arguments and evidence first.
    * Then reveal the conclusion.
    * This is more suitable for team discussions, brainstorming, or when the audience may be skeptical.

  The speaker illustrates this with a story about his son asking to play Nintendo Switch: the child lists reasons (finished homework, did well on tests, confident about tomorrow’s study), and then makes the request. It is a simple example of building a mini-pyramid to persuade.

  **中文翻译**
  第二个“微技能”是 **金字塔原理（Pyramid Principle）**。

  可以把它想象成一个金字塔：

  * 顶部：一个清晰的结论或主要观点；
  * 中间：2–4 个关键支撑论点；
  * 底部：支撑每个论点的事实、数据和分析。

  顾问几乎在所有场合都用这个结构：思考问题、写邮件、做汇报、开会讨论等。这也是为什么很多麦肯锡顾问特别执着于“3 点式”表达——超过 3 点就会尝试合并或优先级排序，直到形成干净的三段式故事线。

  构建金字塔主要有两种方式：

  1. **自下而上（从证据到洞见）**

     * 先收集所有相关的事实、数据和观察。
     * 用 MECE 原则把这些信息分组。
     * 对每一组问一句 “So what?”（这说明了什么？）
     * “So what” 的回答就变成一个洞见或小结论。

  2. **自上而下（从假设到支撑）**

     * 先从一个初步结论或假设出发。
     * 问：“如果这个结论成立，必须同时成立的 2–3 个条件是什么？”
     * 这些条件就是支撑论点。
     * 然后围绕每个论点去找数据和分析来验证或支撑。

  好的“综合（synthesis）”不仅仅是摘要，而是把零散信息转化为一个别人能理解、也愿意接受的逻辑结构的过程。

  在沟通中，金字塔可以有两种方向：

  * **直接式（自上而下）沟通**：

    * 先给结论；
    * 再给 2–3 个理由；
    * 最后再展示必要证据；
    * 适合高层领导、决策者。

  * **间接式（自下而上）沟通**：

    * 先讲理由和证据；
    * 最后才给出结论；
    * 更适合团队讨论、头脑风暴或者观众可能比较怀疑的场合。

  讲者用儿子想玩游戏机 Nintendo Switch 的例子来说明：先列出理由（作业做完、考试成绩好、对明天学习有信心），然后提出请求。这个简单故事其实就是一个小型的“说服金字塔”。

  [18:27–18:35] **Seven-step problem solving and the doctor analogy**

  **English (refined)**
  At the “macro” level, McKinsey teaches a **seven-step problem-solving process**:

  1. Define the problem.
  2. Structure the problem.
  3. Prioritize issues.
  4. Plan the work.
  5. Conduct analyses.
  6. Synthesize findings.
  7. Develop and communicate recommendations.

  This framework is inspired by a classic four-step mathematical problem-solving method (understand the problem, devise a plan, carry out the plan, look back), but extended for real consulting projects.

  The doctor analogy makes it easier to understand:

  1. **Define the problem**

     * The doctor starts by asking: “What’s wrong? Where do you feel unwell?”
     * In consulting, this is clarifying what the client actually wants to solve.

  2. **Structure hypotheses (structure the problem)**

     * The doctor develops 1–3 hypotheses about possible causes.
     * For simple cases, there might be just one; for complex cases, several MECE hypotheses.

  3. **Prioritize issues**

     * The doctor cannot test everything at once.
     * Life-threatening possibilities are checked first; low-risk causes can wait.

  4. **Plan the work**

     * Decide which tests to run, in what sequence, and how to bundle them (e.g., multiple blood tests at once).

  5. **Conduct analyses**

     * Run tests, collect lab results, and analyze them.

  6. **Synthesize**

     * Combine all results to identify the most likely diagnosis.

  7. **Recommend and communicate**

     * Explain the diagnosis and treatment plan to the patient and family.

  In real life, this process is **not strictly linear**. As new information appears, you may go back to refine the structure, update hypotheses, or re-prioritize. The important part is: at any given moment, you should know which step you are currently working on and why.

  **中文翻译**
  在“宏观”层面，麦肯锡常用一个 **七步法问题解决框架**：

  1. 界定问题（Define the problem）；
  2. 结构化问题（Structure the problem）；
  3. 识别并排序关键议题（Prioritize issues）；
  4. 规划工作（Plan the work）；
  5. 开展分析（Conduct analyses）；
  6. 综合结论（Synthesize findings）；
  7. 形成并传达建议（Develop and communicate recommendations）。

  这个框架源自经典的数学四步法（理解问题、制定计划、执行、回顾），再结合真实项目进行了扩展。

  用“看医生”的类比会更好理解：

  1. **界定问题**

     * 医生先问：“哪里不舒服？你感觉怎么样？”
     * 在咨询中，就是弄清楚客户真正想解决的是什么问题。

  2. **结构化假设（结构化问题）**

     * 医生会提出 1–3 个可能病因的假设。
     * 简单情况可能只有一个；复杂情况会有多个，并尽量做到 MECE。

  3. **优先级排序**

     * 医生不可能一次性做完全部检查。
     * 威胁生命的可能性要优先排查；低风险的可以往后放。

  4. **规划工作**

     * 决定做哪些检查、先做什么后做什么、哪些可以打包一起做（例如一起抽血做多项检测）。

  5. **开展分析**

     * 做检查、拿到化验结果，并对结果进行分析。

  6. **综合判断**

     * 把所有结果结合起来，得出最有可能的诊断。

  7. **给出并沟通建议**

     * 向病人和家属解释病情和治疗方案。

  在真实项目中，这个过程 **并不是严格线性** 的。随着新信息出现，你可能得回到前面的步骤，重新修正结构、更新假设或调整优先级。关键在于：任何时刻你都要清楚自己当前处在第几步、为什么在做这一步。


  [18:35–18:41] **The difficulty of defining the problem and the alien example**

  **English (refined)**
  Step 1, “define the problem,” seems simple but is often the hardest.

  The speaker shares a project with a Chinese company that wanted to downsize its R&D team. The consulting team framed the problem as:

  * Analyze each team’s contribution to revenue.
  * Identify which teams are “oversized” relative to their financial impact.
  * Recommend where to cut staff.

  Analytically, the work was solid. However, the project **failed** because the real question the CEO cared about was different: he wanted political and organizational help in executing his own vision for restructuring, not a purely quantitative headcount optimization. The true challenge was about people, not formulas.

  In the end, the better solution was to spin off a separate company to host some of the people instead of simply firing them. That conclusion is quite different from the original analytical framing. This shows:

  > You can do excellent analysis and still fail if you define the wrong problem.

  To make the seven steps more fun, the speaker picks a toy question:

  > “Why aren’t aliens visiting Earth?”

  A simple, clear problem statement might be:

  * We know there are billions of planets in the universe.
  * We do not observe aliens visiting Earth (at least as far as we know).
  * We want to understand what factors might be preventing them from coming.

  He then structures the problem using a marketing-style funnel:

  1. **Awareness** – Do aliens even know Earth exists?
  2. **Access** – Even if they know, can they physically reach Earth?
  3. **Attractiveness** – Is Earth attractive enough to visit?
  4. **Alternatives** – Do they have more attractive places to go?
  5. **Risk** – Would visiting Earth be too risky (e.g., humans may attack them)?

  This is an example of reusing existing structures (here, a customer-journey/marketing framework) to structure a completely different problem.


  **中文翻译**
  第 1 步“界定问题”看起来最简单，实际上往往最难。

  讲者分享了一个中国企业的案例：这家公司想裁减一部分研发团队。咨询团队最初是这样定义问题的：

  * 分析各个团队对收入的贡献；
  * 找出相对于财务回报“人太多”的团队；
  * 给出应该裁哪些人的建议。

  从分析角度看，这个工作做得很扎实。但是项目最后 **失败了**，因为 CEO 真正在意的问题不止是“人多不多、性价比高不高”，而是：如何按他自己的愿景重组团队，以及这一过程在人事、政治上的可执行性。真正的挑战是“人和组织”，而不是“纯公式”。

  最终比较好的方案是：把一部分人拆出去，成立新的子公司来承接，而不是简单裁员。这个结论和一开始“头数优化”的问题定义有很大差异。说明：

  > 即使分析做得很好，如果一开始问题定义错了，整个项目仍然可能失败。

  为了让七步法更好理解，讲者举了一个有趣的玩具问题：

  > “为什么外星人没有来地球？”

  一个简洁的“问题定义”可以是：

  * 我们知道宇宙中有上百亿颗行星；
  * 但至少在我们的认知里，没有看到外星人来地球；
  * 我们想了解是什么因素阻止他们来。

  接着，他用营销漏斗类比来结构化这个问题：

  1. **认知（Awareness）**——外星人是否知道地球的存在？
  2. **可达性（Access）**——即使知道，他们在物理上能否到达地球？
  3. **吸引力（Attractiveness）**——地球对他们是否足够有吸引力？
  4. **替代选择（Alternatives）**——宇宙中是否有更值得去的地方？
  5. **风险（Risk）**——来地球是否太危险（例如人类会攻击他们）？

  这是一个把“现成结构”（这里是市场/用户旅程框架）借用到完全不同问题上的例子。


  [18:41–18:48] **Prioritizing, analyzing, and synthesizing the alien problem**

  **English (refined)**
  Next comes **prioritization**. We may not be able to analyze all five dimensions with equal depth, especially when data is limited.

  Which dimensions can we realistically analyze from Earth’s perspective?

  * **Awareness**: We can approximate this by examining our own radio signals and electromagnetic emissions. If we can detect similar patterns from space, we might infer that other civilizations could also detect us.
  * **Risk**: We can reason about how dangerous humans might appear to an alien civilization (wars, weapons, instability).
  * **Attractiveness**: We can subjectively gauge Earth’s conditions (resources, environment, culture) versus an imagined advanced civilization’s standards.

  But **Access** and **Alternatives** are hard to evaluate because we know nothing about alien technology or their other options. So we can deprioritize those for now.

  After doing conceptual “analysis” on Awareness, Attractiveness, and Risk, the speaker synthesizes two simple messages:

  1. **Earth is tiny and insignificant at the cosmic scale.**
  2. **Earth, as it is today, may not be attractive enough for advanced civilizations to bother visiting.**

  Then comes the **recommendation and communication** step: how do we present this to different audiences?

  * The image of Earth as a pale blue dot, taken from the far edge of the solar system, is used to show how small and fragile our planet is.
  * A campaign like “Heal the World” (referencing Michael Jackson) can emphasize that if we want to be “worth visiting,” we need to behave better as humans and improve our world.

  This closes the loop of the seven steps on a playful example:

  * Start with a clear problem statement.
  * Apply a structure.
  * Prioritize dimensions.
  * Plan what to analyze.
  * Conduct analyses (conceptual here).
  * Synthesize findings.
  * Recommend and communicate using a compelling story and visuals.

  PowerPoint exists mainly to support that last step: broadcasting the story in a structured way.


  **中文翻译**
  接下来是 **优先级排序**。在数据有限的前提下，我们不一定能对五个维度都做同样深入的分析。

  从地球的角度，哪些维度是我们勉强还能分析一下的？

  * **认知（Awareness）**：可以从我们自己向宇宙发出的无线电和电磁信号类比——如果我们能探测到类似信号，就可以推测其他文明也可能探测到我们。
  * **风险（Risk）**：可以从人类自身的战争、武器、社会不稳定等，推理在外星文明眼中我们有多危险。
  * **吸引力（Attractiveness）**：可以主观比较地球的资源、环境、文化等，想象对一个高等文明是否有吸引力。

  但 **可达性（Access）** 和 **替代选择（Alternatives）** 几乎无法评估，因为我们不了解外星技术，也不知道他们还有哪些“旅游目的地”。所以可以暂时降级这两项的优先级。

  经过对“认知、吸引力、风险”的概念性分析后，讲者把结论综合成两句简单的话：

  1. **在宇宙尺度上，地球非常渺小**；
  2. **以我们现在的状态，地球可能还不值得高等文明特地跑一趟**。

  然后进入第七步：**建议与沟通**——如何把这个结论讲给不同受众听？

  * 通过那张著名的“暗淡蓝点”照片（从太阳系边缘拍摄到的地球），直观展示地球有多小、多脆弱。
  * 借用类似 “Heal the World” 这样的概念，传递一个信息：如果我们希望“值得被拜访”，就需要先把人类文明自身建设好。

  这就完整走完了七步法在一个趣味题上的应用：

  * 先清晰定义问题；
  * 再搭建结构；
  * 做优先级排序；
  * 规划要分析什么；
  * 进行（这里是概念性的）分析；
  * 综合出简洁有力的结论；
  * 最后用故事与视觉，把结论讲给别人听。

  PowerPoint 的存在，本质上就是为了支撑最后一步，把故事以结构化方式“广播”出去。

  [18:50–18:59] **Predictive AI vs Generative AI, and their limitations**

  **English (refined)**
  The talk then moves to AI and its impact on consulting.

  Historically, consulting firms used **predictive AI**:

  * Use numeric data to predict numeric outcomes (demand, churn, risk, etc.).
  * This is “left-brain” work: factual, planned, math-driven, and structured.
  * When the speaker joined McKinsey as a data scientist, much of his early value was simply being able to open and process large data files other consultants could not handle in Excel.

  Later, McKinsey acquired a machine-learning startup (QuantumBlack) and integrated more advanced data science and visualization into projects. This represents the predictive AI era.

  Now we have **generative AI**, which affects the “right-brain” side:

  * It can create text, images, video, code, and more from prompts.
  * It is creative, divergent, and sometimes unpredictable.
  * It opens up powerful new possibilities but introduces new types of errors.

  He shows a football free-kick example where AI discovers an unintuitive “tunneling” strategy by learning to bend the ball through formations—illustrating how AI can find patterns that take humans years to notice.

  However, both predictive and generative AI have serious limitations and risks:

  * **Bias and overfitting** in predictive AI

    * If past hiring practices were biased, a hiring model trained on that data will also be biased and discriminatory.
    * Overfitting means a model memorizes historical data instead of learning generalizable patterns. It performs well on old data but fails badly on new situations.

  * **Misalignment and “political correctness” in generative AI**

    * An early image model generated racially “balanced” German WWII soldiers because it over-corrected for representation, ignoring historical facts.
    * This shows how alignment training can sometimes distort factual accuracy.

  * **Prompt injection and jailbreaks**

    * The “grandma exploit” is an example where users wrap a harmful request (e.g., learning how to pirate movies) inside a role-play story about “grandma telling a bedtime story,” bypassing safety filters.
    * Researchers have also managed to get models to output very detailed instructions for dangerous activities (e.g., making a bomb), which then have to be heavily redacted.

  * **Hallucination**

    * A well-known early mistake: when asked “Who was the sole survivor of the Titanic?” some models completely made up a name and story, even though that person never existed.
    * The answer sounded fluent and confident, but it was entirely fictional.

  These examples highlight why understanding AI’s strengths and weaknesses is critical for consultants: AI can be extremely powerful, but also confidently wrong or subtly biased.

  **中文翻译**
  接着，话题转向 AI 以及它对咨询行业的影响。

  历史上，咨询公司主要使用的是 **预测型 AI（Predictive AI）**：

  * 用数值数据来预测数值结果（需求、流失率、风险等）；
  * 这是典型的“左脑工作”：重事实、重计划、重数学和结构化；
  * 讲者刚加入麦肯锡做数据科学家时，早期的价值很大一部分就是：能打开并处理其他顾问用 Excel 都打不开的大数据文件。

  后来，麦肯锡收购了机器学习创业公司 QuantumBlack，把更先进的数据科学与可视化整合进项目里，这是预测型 AI 的阶段。

  现在进入的是 **生成式 AI（Generative AI）** 时代：

  * 它可以根据提示生成文本、图片、视频、代码等；
  * 更偏“右脑”：创造性、发散性，有时也难以预测；
  * 带来了非常强大的新能力，同时也带来全新类型的错误与风险。

  讲者展示了一个足球任意球的例子：AI 通过不断学习，发现了一种“穿墙”式的奇怪射门方式，把球弯穿人墙——这种套路可能需要人类球员多年才能摸索出来，体现了 AI 在模式发现上的强大。

  但无论是预测型还是生成式 AI，都有明显局限与风险：

  * **预测型 AI 的偏见与过拟合**

    * 如果历史招聘数据本身就对某些族群有歧视，那么基于这些数据训练出来的模型也会带有系统性偏见。
    * 过拟合意味着模型“背题”而不是“学规律”：在旧数据上表现极好，但在新情况面前表现极差。

  * **生成式 AI 的对齐与“政治正确”问题**

    * 某些早期图像模型在生成“二战德国士兵”时，会强行生成各种族的士兵，以追求“多元代表性”，却忽略了实际历史事实。
    * 这说明安全与对齐训练有时会扭曲事实准确性。

  * **越狱与 Prompt 注入**

    * “奶奶故事”之类的越狱方法，把非法请求（比如下载盗版电影）包装在“奶奶讲睡前故事”的角色扮演里，从而绕过安全过滤。
    * 研究者也成功诱导模型给出非常详细的危险操作步骤（如自制爆炸物），这些内容后来必须被严格打码。

  * **幻觉（Hallucination）**

    * 一个著名早期错误是：被问“泰坦尼克号唯一幸存者是谁？”时，模型一本正经地编造了一个从未存在过的人物和故事。
    * 回答看起来非常流畅、有说服力，但完全是捏造的。

  这些例子表明：顾问必须清楚 AI 的长处和短板——它既可以极其强大，也可能非常自信地犯严重错误或带有隐蔽偏见。

  [19:01–19:08] **How GenAI fits into MECE, the Pyramid, and the seven steps; be Brad Pitt, not the data scientist**

  **English (refined)**
  The speaker then asks: if we give generative AI the same tasks—MECE structuring, Pyramid Principle, seven-step problem solving—what happens?

  * When asked to structure “Why aren’t aliens visiting Earth?” using MECE, the model produced a structure that was somewhat reasonable but not fully MECE and not particularly elegant. It looked like the output of a junior consultant’s first attempt that still needs revision.
  * When asked to produce a pyramid for the same problem, it generated five key points instead of three, again showing that it does not naturally follow McKinsey’s “rule of three.”

  Conclusion:

  * Generative AI can be useful in the **ideation** phase—providing starting points, angles, and draft structures.
  * But a human consultant still has to critique, refine, and reshape these outputs using MECE and the Pyramid Principle.

  Where does AI help most in the **seven steps**?

  * It can propose initial problem framings and hypotheses.
  * It can help structure issues and suggest possible trees.
  * It can assist with analysis and synthesis, especially for large datasets or long documents.
  * It can draft communication materials (slides, narratives, visuals).

  Where is it weaker?

  * It cannot interview clients and read the room.
  * It cannot build trust with stakeholders.
  * It can fabricate facts or overlook politics and human constraints.

  The speaker ends with the **Moneyball** analogy:

  * In the movie “Moneyball,” the data analyst is crucial, but the star is Brad Pitt’s character (the manager) who decides what to ask, how to use the data, and how to implement the changes.
  * AI is like the data analyst.
  * You need to be Brad Pitt—the one who frames the problem, chooses which analyses matter, makes trade-offs, and leads action.

  **中文翻译**
  接下来，讲者把问题抛回到“方法论”上：如果让生成式 AI 来做 MECE、金字塔和七步法，会怎样？

  * 当让模型用 MECE 来结构化 “为什么外星人不来地球？” 这个问题时，它给出的结构“勉强说得过去”，但既不完全 MECE，也不够优雅，看上去很像“新手顾问第一次写的 issue tree，还需要带教修改”。
  * 当让模型按金字塔原理搭故事时，它列了 5 个主点，而不是 3 个，说明它并不会自然遵守麦肯锡式的“三点结构”。

  结论：

  * 生成式 AI 在 **“发散与起稿”阶段很有用**，能提供初始结构、角度与草稿。
  * 但人类顾问仍然必须用 MECE 和金字塔原理去批判、筛选、重组这些输出。

  在 **七步法** 中，AI 最能帮忙的是：

  * 提出初步的问题表述和假设；
  * 帮助结构化议题、给出可能的 issue tree；
  * 辅助做分析和初步综合，尤其是面对大数据或长文档时；
  * 草拟沟通材料（文案、故事线、图像）。

  AI 的弱项在于：

  * 它不能亲自访谈客户，也读不出现场气氛；
  * 它无法替你建立与关键利益相关者之间的信任；
  * 它会编造事实，忽略政治和人性限制。

  讲者用电影 **《点球成金》（Moneyball）** 作比喻：

  * 片中数据分析师非常重要，但真正的主角是 Brad Pitt 扮演的球队经理——他决定问什么问题、如何用数据、以及如何落实变革。
  * AI 更像那位数据分析师。
  * 你需要做的是 Brad Pitt：负责定义问题、决定哪些分析重要、做权衡、并带领真正的行动。

  [19:08–19:22] **Q&A: AI’s impact on consulting jobs, learning structure, and skills for the future**

  **English (refined)**

  1. **Impact of AI on junior consulting roles**

     * Top firms (Bain, McKinsey, BCG, etc.) are already heavily investing in AI, including their own internal LLMs.
     * Example: McKinsey’s internal assistant “Lili,” trained on all McKinsey documents, can do fact-checking and knowledge retrieval for consultants.
     * The goal is to **accelerate** project delivery, not straightforwardly replace consultants. Entry-level roles will change, but problem framing, stakeholder management, and trust-building remain human.

  2. **How to get better at structuring (MECE, Pyramid, seven steps)**

     * These frameworks are not just methods; they are also a **shared language** inside consulting firms.
     * When everyone uses MECE, Pyramid, and seven steps, they can argue efficiently and align quickly on where they disagree.
     * With practice, these steps become internalized habits rather than a checklist you consciously follow.
     * One helpful trick: **“small to big”** — first apply MECE and Pyramid to small tasks (emails, short problems), then extend the same thinking to larger projects.

  3. **What skills should the next generation develop in an AI era?**
     The speaker’s advice to his son:

     * **Play with AI tools early**: get used to what AI can do and cannot do; treat it as a normal part of work.
     * **Understand logical thinking and “pseudo-coding”**, not necessarily programming syntax:

       * Know concepts like loops, conditions, data flows.
       * This is the language you will use to communicate with AI and other tools.
     * **Get to “good enough” fast, not perfect**:

       * With abundant information and AI support, the advantage is in reaching a solid 80% solution faster than others.
       * The last 20% perfection often costs disproportionate effort and is not always necessary.

  4. **Project timing and 80/20**

     * There is no fixed universal schedule (e.g., “Week 1 define, Week 2 structure…”), since projects differ.
     * But 80/20 applies strongly: about 20% of the effort typically generates 80% of the insight.
     * In a 6-week project, perhaps 2–3 weeks should be focused on the critical analyses that drive most of the value; the rest is preparation, alignment, and packaging.

  5. **Personal career path into consulting**

     * At SAP, the speaker enjoyed explaining analytics to business people more than just coding, and liked presenting and influencing.
     * A headhunter noticed this fit and connected him to McKinsey right when they were beginning to hire data scientists in APAC.
     * Now, all major consulting firms are actively searching for people with both technical and business skills.

  **中文翻译**

  1. **AI 对初级咨询岗位的影响**

     * 头部公司（贝恩、麦肯锡、BCG 等）都在大力投入 AI，并自建内部大模型。
     * 例如麦肯锡的内部助手 “Lili”，基于所有麦肯锡文档训练，能为顾问做事实校验和知识检索。
     * 目标是 **加速** 项目交付，而不是简单“用 AI 替代顾问”。入门岗位的日常工作会发生改变，但问题定义、利益相关者管理和信任构建仍然高度依赖人。

  2. **如何提升结构化能力（MECE、金字塔、七步法）**

     * 这些框架不仅是“方法”，也是咨询公司内部的 **通用语言**。
     * 大家都用 MECE、金字塔和七步法时，争论会更高效，很快就能对齐：到底在第几步、哪个分支上意见不合。
     * 随着实践，它们会从“显式步骤”变成“潜意识习惯”，不再需要逐条对照。
     * 一个有用的小技巧是 **“从小到大”**：先在小问题（邮件、简短任务）上刻意使用 MECE 和金字塔，然后自然地把同样的思路扩展到更大的项目。

  3. **在 AI 时代，下一代应具备哪些能力？**
     针对儿子，讲者给出的建议：

     * **尽早、多玩各种 AI 工具**：熟悉 AI 能做什么、不能做什么，把它当作自然的工作工具。
     * **理解“逻辑上的编程”，而不必纠结具体语言语法**：

       * 知道循环、条件、数据流这些概念；
       * 这是未来与 AI 和其他工具沟通的“思维语言”。
     * **更快达到“足够好”，而不是执着完美**：

       * 在信息充裕又有 AI 的环境里，优势在于比别人更快到达 80 分的解决方案；
       * 追求最后 20 分的完美往往需要巨大的额外成本，而且并不总是必要。

  4. **项目周期与 80/20 原则**

     * 没有一刀切的时间表（比如“第一周定义、第二周结构化……”），项目情况差异很大。
     * 但 80/20 非常适用：20% 的工作往往产出 80% 的洞见。
     * 在一个 6 周项目里，也许 2–3 周要集中在真正关键的分析上，其余时间主要用来准备、对齐和包装。

  5. **个人如何走进咨询行业**

     * 在 SAP 时，他发现自己更喜欢向业务人员解释分析结果、做讲解和影响决策，而不只是写代码。
     * 猎头注意到这种“技术 + 商业沟通”匹配，在麦肯锡开始在亚太招聘数据科学家的窗口期把他推了进去。
     * 如今，各大咨询公司都非常希望找到既懂技术又懂业务的人才。
## Week 7 Topic 7 Rough Rapid Right 10.02
  * [18:06–18:08] **From prompt engineering to problem definition**
    Just go to a GenAI tool like ChatGPT. You start by asking it a question such as “How do I forecast exchange rates?” and it will give you five or six guidelines. This shows that AI is progressing very quickly. Previously, people thought “prompt engineering” itself would become a big thing. But the more I think about what good prompt engineering really is, the more I see that it is fundamentally about problem definition. Earlier, I mentioned the S.M.A.R.T. framework: you need to phrase your problem statement so that it is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, and written clearly enough for both humans and AI to understand.

    直接去用像 ChatGPT 这样的生成式 AI 工具就可以了。你先问它一个问题，比如“我要怎么做汇率预测？”，它通常会给你五六条操作建议。这个例子说明 AI 的能力进步得非常快。之前很多人以为“提示词工程”本身会是一门很大的学问，但越想越会发现，真正好的提示词，本质上就是好的问题定义。之前提过 S.M.A.R.T. 框架：问题陈述要做到具体（Specific）、可衡量（Measurable）、可实现（Achievable）、相关（Relevant）、有时间界限（Time-bound），而且要写得足够清楚，让人也好、AI 也好，都能看懂。

  * [18:07–18:08] **Course plan and today’s topic: Rough Rapid Right**
    For the remaining weeks of the module, we will continue with project consultations, you will present in person, and then you will submit your final deliverables. That is the overall plan. For today, I am going to share a technique that I personally synthesised from several sources: my consulting experience, the academic literature, and different problem-solving methods. I call this the “Rough, Rapid, Right” narrative approach. If you think about design thinking, this roughly corresponds to the prototyping stage: you do something rough, you do it quickly, and you keep iterating to get it “right enough” for learning.

    这门课接下来的几周，我们会继续做项目咨询，你们需要现场做展示，然后提交最终成果。这是整体安排。今天我要讲的是一个我自己综合出来的方法，来源包括我做咨询的经验、一些文献，还有不同问题求解方法的做法。我把它叫作 “Rough, Rapid, Right”（粗略、快速、对路）叙事法。对应到设计思维，大概就是原型阶段：先做一个粗糙的版本，做得快一点，多迭代几轮，让它在“方向正确”的意义上足够好，便于学习和改进。

  * [18:08–18:10] **What “Rough, Rapid, Right” means**
    The idea of “Rough, Rapid, Right” is that when you start, you do not try to perfect everything. You make something rough, then you do it rapidly, and you do it iteratively. Each iteration gets you a bit closer to the right direction. For example, suppose a hotel wants to test whether using autonomous robots to deliver items to guest rooms would work. Instead of immediately investing in full-scale robot deployment, they might start with a very simple prototype or even a “fake robot” experiment, just to observe how guests react: Do they find it convenient? Do they find it strange? Only after they see that the basic idea works will they commit more resources. That is a typical “rough, rapid, right” mindset.

    “Rough, Rapid, Right”的核心思想就是：一开始不要追求完美，而是先做一个粗糙版本，然后快速行动、不断迭代，每一轮都让方案朝着正确的方向推进。举个例子，一家酒店想测试用送货机器人把东西送到房间是否可行。他们不需要一开始就大规模买很多机器人，而是可以先做一个很简单的原型，甚至用“假的机器人实验”来观察顾客反应：客人会觉得方便还是奇怪？只有在确认这个想法基本可行以后，才再投入更多资源。这个就是典型的 “粗略、快速、对路” 的思维方式。

  * [18:10–18:12] **Starting the project: from problem to balance sheet**
    In your projects, some of you are already starting to move beyond the abstract problem statement. For example, if the theme park owner wants to improve profit, you might begin by looking at the company’s balance sheet or P&L statement. You then examine which areas show overspending or under-performance, and from there you start to conceptualise a clearer problem statement. That is already the beginning of applying a structured, narrative-driven approach.

    在你们的项目里，有些同学已经开始从抽象的问题陈述往前走了一步。比如，乐园老板想提高利润时，你们可以先看公司的资产负债表或损益表，看看哪些项目花得太多、哪些收入板块表现不好，然后再据此把问题陈述具体化、系统化。这其实已经是在用一种结构化、带叙事性的方式来处理问题了。

  * [18:12–18:13] **Storyboard: start with your final slides**
    The trigger for this approach came from observing experienced consultants. The first thing they often do is to take a big piece of paper and divide it into six boxes, like a storyboard. Why six? Because in one month’s time, you are supposed to stand in front of the client and present maybe five or six key slides with your recommended solution. So we begin with the end in mind: assume you have six slides—what would each slide be about?

    这个方法的灵感来自一些资深顾问。我发现他们做项目时，第一件事就是拿一张大纸，把它划成六个格子，就像故事板一样。为什么是六个格子？因为一个月之后，你站到客户面前，很可能就是用五六页关键的幻灯片来讲你的最终建议。所以我们要“以终为始”：先假设你最后会有六页关键的投影片，那每一页大概要讲什么？

  * [18:13–18:15] **A 6-slide narrative skeleton**
    Think of it this way: in a month’s time, what you physically hand over is a set of slides. Let us say there are six key slides. Slide 1 is usually the background or context. The final slide is often the action plan or “next steps”—this sounds more positive than simply saying “conclusion”. Between the first and the last, you need to decide what the other four slides are. One very common structure is:

    1. Background; 2) Problem or challenge statement; 3) Analysis or diagnosis; 4) Possible solutions; 5) Chosen solution; 6) Next steps.

    可以这样想：一个月后你真正交付给对方的是一套投影片。假设有六张关键页，第 1 张通常是背景或情境说明，最后一张往往是行动计划或“下一步”（比单纯写 conclusion 更积极）。中间另外四张，就要由你来设计。一种非常常见的结构是：
    ① 背景介绍；② 问题或挑战陈述；③ 分析或诊断；④ 备选方案；⑤ 选定方案；⑥ 下一步行动。

  * [18:15–18:17] **From current state to future state**
    If you recall what we discussed in earlier topics, all problem solving is essentially moving from the current situation (“as-is”) to a desirable future situation (“to-be”). So in your narrative, somewhere you must make that explicit: What is our current situation? What is the desired future state? What are the possible solutions to get there? And which solution are we actually recommending? Even if you have not done any analysis yet, just drafting this six-slide storyline as a group can already clarify your narrative and align everyone.

    回想之前几次课说过的内容，所有问题求解，本质上都是从“现状（as-is）”走向“理想状态（to-be）”。所以在你的叙事结构里，必须在某个地方把这条路径讲清楚：现在的状况是什么？理想目标是什么？有哪些可能的方案可以把我们从 A 拉到 B？最后我们推荐的是哪一个方案？即使你还没真正做分析，只是团队先把这六张幻灯片的大纲写出来，也已经可以把叙事理顺，让大家对故事线有共同认识。

  * [18:17–18:18] **Why narrative first: avoid wasted effort**
    Notice that at this point, you have not actually done any detailed work yet, but the narrative is already clear. Without this, a group of five or six students may each rush off to do interviews, data collection, and fancy analysis, but at the end realise that much of it cannot be used in the final report. That is wasted effort. I often remind students: if an activity cannot eventually be reflected in your slides or report, you should seriously question whether it is worth doing.

    注意，到目前为止你们其实还没有做任何很细的工作，但故事线已经比较清楚了。如果没有这一步，五六个人的小组很容易各自跑去做访谈、找资料、做很复杂的分析，最后才发现很多东西根本放不到最后的报告里—那其实就是白忙一场。所以我常跟同学讲：如果你做的一件事情，最后在投影片或报告里完全体现不出来，那你就要认真怀疑这件事值不值得做。

  * [18:18–18:20] **Emotional attachment and selection**
    Another problem is emotional attachment. You might spend a lot of time on some website or some very interesting catalogue, and naturally you feel, “I worked so hard on this, we must put it into the slides.” Then you hope the professor will “pick and choose”. But to me, that usually signals that you are not sure what your core narrative is, and you do not know what to include or exclude. A clear storyline forces you to be disciplined about what truly supports the message and what does not.

    还有一个常见问题是“感情投入”。比如你花了很多时间在某个网站上，挖到一个非常有趣的目录或资料，你自然会觉得：“我那么辛苦查的，一定要放进投影片。” 然后就期待老师自己去“挑”。在我看来，这往往说明你对自己的核心叙事还不清楚，也不知道哪些内容是真正支撑故事的、哪些只是噪音。有了清晰的故事线，你就必须更有纪律地判断：什么内容真的在服务这个信息，什么不是。

  * [18:20–18:23] **Storyboard and the “story flow”**
    What we are building here is what I call a story flow. Each slide has a main message, and together they form a narrative arc from problem to solution. Once the narrative is set, you can plan how to divide your time and effort. Students who do not have this often spend too much time on the first few slides, and by the time they get to the later parts, they either rush or under-develop them. A simple storyboard gives you a visual map: “This part is done, I can move on; that part is still empty, I must focus there.”

    我这里说的就是一个“故事流”。每一页投影片都有一个核心信息，这些信息连起来，就形成了从问题到解决方案的叙事弧线。有了这个叙事，你才能合理规划时间和精力。如果没有，很多同学会在前面几张幻灯片花太多时间，后面真正关键的部分就做不完、做不深。有了一个简单的故事板，你就可以很直观地看到：这个部分差不多了，可以往下推进；那个部分还是空白，需要优先补上。

  * [18:23–18:24] **Beware confirmation bias in narratives**
    However, there is a warning. Once you have a narrative that you like, you may develop a bias: you start to selectively look for evidence that supports your storyline and ignore data that contradicts it. This is confirmation bias. If you think, “Professor X is a good professor,” you tend to notice only positive signals and explain away negative ones. Similarly, if you are too attached to your ghost deck, you might avoid alternative explanations or data that would force you to revise it. So you must consciously ask: “What data could disprove our current narrative?”

    但这里也有一个提醒。一旦你对自己的故事线很满意，就容易产生偏见：你会下意识地只去找支持这个故事的证据，而忽略与之相反的数据，这就是确认偏误。就好像你一开始认定“某位老师一定很好”，之后看到的都是正面信号，负面现象你会自动帮他找借口。同样地，如果你太依赖自己那份 ghost deck，就会不愿意去寻找可能推翻它的证据或其他解释。所以你要刻意问自己：“有什么数据如果出现，会证明我们现在的故事是错的？”

  * [18:25–18:27] **Two types of narratives: research vs senior management**
    The structure we have been using—background, problem statement, analysis, issue tree, possible solutions, chosen solution, implementation or next steps—is essentially a research/problem-solving narrative. It mirrors what you see in academic papers: motivation, research objectives, literature review, methodology, results, conclusions, and future work. This is the narrative we will use in this course, because I want you to internalise the problem-solving process, not just jump from “problem” to “answer”. In contrast, when you present to senior management in real life, you often start with the answer first and only explain the process if they are not convinced.

    我们现在用的这个结构——背景、问题陈述、分析、议题树、可能方案、选定方案、实施或下一步——本质上就是一种“研究／问题求解”的叙事方式，和学术论文的结构非常像：动机、研究目标、文献综述、方法、结果、结论和后续工作。这个就是本课程要求你们采用的叙事，因为我希望你们先把“怎么系统地解题”这件事学扎实，而不是一下子从“有问题”跳到“答案就是 X”。相反，在真实职场里，对高层做简报时，经常是先报结论，如果他们不信，再补充你是如何得到这个结论的。

  * [18:27–18:30] **Horizontal vs vertical logic (1): definitions**
    When you create slides, there are two components. First is horizontal logic: this is the sequence of slide headlines or key messages that carry the story from one slide to the next. Second is vertical logic: this is the content within each slide—bullet points, charts, tables, figures—that supports that slide’s main message. Horizontal logic answers “Does the story flow from slide 1 to slide 2 to slide 3?” Vertical logic answers “Does the evidence in this slide support its headline?”

    做投影片时，其实有两个层面的逻辑。第一是“水平逻辑”，也就是每一页的标题或关键信息串起来，能不能把故事从第 1 页自然带到第 2 页，再到第 3 页。第二是“垂直逻辑”，也就是单页内部的内容——项目符号、图表、数据等——是不是在支撑这一页的核心标题。水平逻辑回答的是“整套投影片的故事流顺不顺”；垂直逻辑回答的是“这一页的证据有没有真正支撑标题说的话”。

  * [18:29–18:30] **Horizontal vs vertical logic (2): the newspaper analogy**
    One way to see this is to look at a newspaper article. The headline is like the horizontal logic: if you read just the headlines of several articles, you still get the key messages. The details in the article—paragraphs, quotes, statistics—are like vertical logic: they support and elaborate on that headline. In your slides, the same principle applies: a short, clear statement as the slide title for horizontal logic, and supporting details beneath for vertical logic.

    一个很好理解的方法是看报纸。每篇报道的标题，就好像你的“水平逻辑”：只看标题，你已经大概知道这篇文章的主旨。而正文里的段落、引用、数据等，就是“垂直逻辑”，用来支撑和展开这个标题。在投影片里也是一样：上面是一句简短有力的标题，负责水平上的故事推进；下面是用来支撑这句话的细节内容，负责垂直上的论证。

  * [18:30–18:32] **Build from horizontal logic first**
    When you use a narrative approach like “Rough, Rapid, Right”, always start with the horizontal logic. In other words, first write the sequence of slide headlines: from background, to problem, to diagnosis, to solutions, to recommendations, to next steps. Only after that do you fill in the vertical logic, i.e., the data and analysis that support each headline. This way, even if you later need to cut slides or rearrange them, your story remains coherent.

    用 “Rough, Rapid, Right” 这种叙事方法时，一定要先做水平逻辑。也就是说，先把每一页的标题按顺序写出来：从背景，到问题，到诊断，到方案，到建议，再到下一步。等这一条主线确定了，再往每一页里面填垂直逻辑，也就是相应的数据和分析。这样即使之后要删减或调整顺序，你的故事线也不会乱掉。

  * [18:40–18:41] **The “drop test” and ghost deck**
    A good test of your horizontal logic is what consultants sometimes call the “drop test”. Imagine you print your slides, stack them together, and then overlay them so that only the titles are visible. If you read just those titles from the first slide to the last, does it form a clear, logical story? If yes, your ghost deck—the skeleton of your presentation—is strong. If not, you need to revise the sequence or wording of your headlines.

    检查水平逻辑有一个很实用的“掉落测试”。想象你把所有投影片打印出来叠在一起，只露出每一页的标题。从第一页的标题读到最后一页，如果光是这些标题就已经讲成一个清晰、有逻辑的故事，那说明你的 ghost deck（也就是整套简报的骨架）是扎实的。如果标题串起来支离破碎、不连贯，就要回去重排顺序或改写标题。

  * [18:41–18:43] **Keep one message per slide**
    Another practical rule I use is: one slide, one main message. Do not overload a slide with three or four big ideas; that forces the audience to work very hard to follow you. Even for myself, when I prepare slides, I often realise that a slide is too dense and I need to split it into two or three simpler ones. Your job is to minimise the cognitive load on your audience, not to show how much information you can cram into one slide.

    还有一个非常实用的原则：一页投影片只讲一个主信息。不要在一页上堆三四个大观点，这样会迫使观众非常费力地去跟上你的思路。连我自己做简报时，也常常发现某一页内容太密，就会把它拆成两三页更简单的版本。你的任务是帮观众减轻“脑力负担”，而不是炫耀自己能在一页里塞多少东西。

  * [19:06–19:08] **Different audiences, different use of narrative**
    In practice, how much of this full problem-solving narrative you show depends on the audience. For senior management who are very busy, you might only use four to six slides and put all the detailed numbers and technical analysis in the appendix. They care about the high-level problem, your recommendation, and the expected impact. However, within this class, I do not want you to skip the problem-solving process and only present the “short version”. Our brains like to jump straight from “We have a problem” to “Here is the solution”, but if you always think and communicate like that, you will not develop disciplined problem-solving skills.

    在实际工作中，要不要把完整的“问题求解故事”全部呈现出来，取决于听众是谁。对很忙的高层，你可能只用四到六页概览，把所有细节数字和技术分析放在附录里；他们主要关心的是：问题是什么、你建议做什么、预期影响有多大。但是在这门课里，我不希望你们跳过问题求解过程，只给我一个“精简版”。大脑很喜欢从“有问题”直接跳到“答案就是某个方案”，但如果你一直用这种方式思考和表达，就很难真正练好系统化解题的能力。

  * [19:08–19:11] **Balancing detail and clarity**
    When you have many possible solutions, you also need to use the narrative to decide what level of detail is appropriate. You cannot spend six or seven slides describing every single option if the audience does not need that. For non-technical audiences, you might summarise categories of solutions and keep details in the appendix. For more technical audiences, you may expand each option. The key is to keep asking: “Is the level of detail on this slide sufficient to support its headline, but not so much that it confuses or overwhelms the audience?”

    当你手上有很多可能方案时，也要用叙事来决定展示的细节层次。不可能用六七页去讲清每一个细微选项，尤其是当听众并不需要那么多细节的时候。对非技术听众，你可以用一两页把方案按类别概括，细节放到附录；对技术听众，则可以把每个方案展开得更细。关键问题要一直问自己：“这一页上的细节，够不够支撑标题，又不会多到让人看了晕掉？”

  * [19:11–19:12] **Incubation and next week’s expectation**
    Finally, one more benefit of this “Rough, Rapid, Right” storyboard approach is that it gives your brain time to incubate ideas. You may draft a ghost deck today, and after a few days or weeks, new insights emerge that help you refine the narrative. Good ideas often come after you have stepped away, rested, or even slept on it. For next week’s project consultation, I expect each group to already have some form of ghost deck or narrative outline. When we meet, show me your six-slide storyline so that we can discuss and improve it together.

    最后，这种 “Rough, Rapid, Right” 的故事板方式还有一个好处，就是给大脑留出了“孵化”的空间。你今天先画出一份 ghost deck，过几天、几个星期之后，新的想法可能会冒出来，帮助你把叙事再打磨一遍。很多好点子都是在你暂时放下、休息、甚至睡一觉之后出现的。所以下周项目咨询时，我希望每个小组都已经有一份初步的 ghost deck 或叙事大纲。到时候就拿出你们设计好的“六页故事线”，我们一起讨论、一起调整。
## Week 8 Topic 8 Creativity sources and process 10.16
  * [18:31–18:32] **Creativity quotes: preparation and chance**
    Louis Pasteur once said, “Chance favors the prepared mind.” Another famous quote, often attributed to Abraham Lincoln, is “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” Put together, these quotes tell us that so-called “lucky breaks” in creativity usually happen to people who have prepared deeply: they have studied, practised, and thought about the problem for a long time before the opportunity arrives.

    巴斯德有一句很有名的话：“机会只垂青有准备的大脑。” 还有一句常被归于林肯的名言：“如果给我六个小时砍倒一棵树，我会先花四个小时磨斧子。” 这两句话合在一起，其实是在提醒我们：创造力里的“好运气”，往往只发生在那些事先做足功课的人身上——他们已经长期在学习、练习、思考这个问题，所以当机会出现时，才能抓得住。

  * [18:44–18:46] **What is creativity? Novel and useful**
    A simple, widely used definition of creativity is that a solution must be both novel and useful. “Novel” means it is the first of its kind, or at least unusual compared with existing ways of solving the problem. That is why we say someone is creative when they solve a problem in a way we have not seen before. “Useful” means the idea actually helps to solve a real problem or create clear value, not just something strange for its own sake.

    一个常用、很实用的创造力定义是：真正有创造性的想法，同时要“新颖”又“有用”。“新颖”指的是，这种做法在过去没见过，或者明显不同于现有的解决方式，所以我们才会说“这个人很有创意”。“有用”则是说，这个想法确实能解决实际问题、产生明显价值，而不是为了怪异而怪异。

  * [18:45–18:46] **Creativity and intellectual property: new, valuable, surprising**
    This definition is very similar to how intellectual property offices think about patents. To get a patent, an invention usually has to be new, valuable, and non-obvious or surprising. For example, if you design a chair and simply change it from four legs to five or six legs, that will not qualify as a patentable invention, because it is obvious that you can add more legs. It is not surprising to a reasonable expert. So creative ideas, like patentable inventions, must go beyond what is obvious.

    这个定义和知识产权里“专利”的标准其实很接近：一个发明通常要“是新的”“有价值”“并且对专业人士来说并非显而易见”。比如，你设计一把椅子，只是从四条腿改成五条腿、六条腿，这就不算真正的发明，因为任何专业人士都能想到“多加几条腿”，没有惊喜感。换句话说，有创造力的想法，就像能拿专利的发明一样，必须超出“理所当然”的范围。

  * [18:48–18:50] **Artists and scientists are also solving problems**
    If you think about scientists, artists, or musicians, they are also solving problems, although the problems may be emotional or expressive rather than purely technical. Many of them feel that existing ways of expressing themselves—current styles of painting, existing musical forms—do not fully capture what they want to say or feel. So they invent a new style of painting, a new kind of music, or a new way of performing. Looked at this way, artists are using creativity to solve their own expression problems, and in doing so they create new forms that the world later recognises as “creative”.

    如果你仔细想想，科学家、艺术家、音乐家其实也都在“解题”，只是他们解决的往往是情感或表达上的问题，而不一定是纯技术问题。很多人觉得，现有的画风、音乐形式，并不能真正表达他们心里的感受，于是就创造出新的绘画方式、新的音乐形式或表演方式。从这个角度看，艺术家是在用创造力解决自己的“表达难题”，而在这个过程中，他们创造出的新形式才被世界称为“有创意”。

  * [18:50–18:52] **Creativity and IQ: related but not the same**
    A common question is: are people with high IQ automatically more creative? Research and experience suggest that high IQ may help you understand complex problems, but it does not guarantee creativity. IQ tests mainly measure logical reasoning, memory, and analytical speed. Creativity, however, also requires the ability to think differently, to connect distant ideas, to tolerate uncertainty, and sometimes to take risks. So people with average IQ can still be highly creative if they develop these qualities.

    一个常见的问题是：高智商的人是不是一定更有创造力？研究和实践都显示，高智商确实有助于理解复杂问题，但并不保证一定有创造力。智商测试主要测的是逻辑、记忆和分析速度，而创造力还需要其他能力：敢于跳出惯常思路、能把看似不相关的点连起来、能容忍不确定和模糊，有时还要敢于冒险。所以，即使是“普通智商”的人，只要这些素质发展得好，也可以非常有创意。

  * [18:52–18:56] **Hard work and routine: the Stravinsky example**
    There is a famous story about the composer Igor Stravinsky. When someone asked how he writes music, he said his routine is to go to the piano at 10 a.m., work until 1 p.m., then continue from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m.—every day. When the “muse” does not visit, he joked, at least he has kept his appointment. The real message is that without long hours of preparation and deliberate practice, you can almost guarantee you will not get good ideas. Deep work on the problem is a necessary condition for creative breakthroughs.

    关于作曲家史特拉文斯基，有一个很经典的故事。别人问他怎么创作音乐，他说：每天 10 点坐到钢琴前，写到下午 1 点；休息一下，再从 2 点工作到晚上 8 点，这就是他的日常。灵感女神没来，他打趣说：至少我准时赴约了。真正的含义是：如果没有长期的准备和刻意练习，几乎可以肯定不会有好点子冒出来。把问题啃深、啃透，是创造性突破的必要前提。

  * [18:56–18:58] **Constraints as fuel for creativity**
    In the real world, creativity is usually triggered by constraints: deadlines, lack of money, limited resources, or physical limits. Musicians, for example, often create rules or frameworks—keys, scales, rhythms—not because sound “needs” them, but to give themselves something to push against. As Jack White famously said, “Opportunity kills creativity”: when you have too many options and no constraints, it becomes harder to be truly creative.

    在真实世界里，创造力往往是被“限制”逼出来的：时间紧、钱不够、资源有限，或者物理条件受限。音乐家之所以会给自己设定各种规则——调性、音阶、节奏——并不是因为声音本身需要这些规则，而是为了给自己一个可以“抵抗、突破”的框架。Jack White 有一句话说得很狠：“太多机会反而会扼杀创造力。” 当选择太多、几乎没什么限制时，反而更难激发真正的创意。

  * [18:57–18:58] **Examples of constraint-driven design: Louvre pyramid and foldable phones**
    Consider the Louvre Museum in Paris. They needed a new main entrance, but the courtyard space was already very crowded. The architect’s creative solution was the glass pyramid: by going underground and using a geometric form that did not block existing buildings, he turned a space constraint into a design icon. Similarly, with smartphones: companies wanted larger screens but still wanted phones to fit into pockets. That constraint drove the development of foldable screens. Without such constraints, no one would have bothered to invent foldable displays.

    比如巴黎的卢浮宫，当时要建新的主入口，但广场空间已经很拥挤了。建筑师最后用玻璃金字塔的方案：往地下挖空间，再用一个不遮挡原有建筑的几何体，既解决了出入口问题，又创造了一个标志性设计。这就是从“场地受限”的约束中逼出来的创意。再看折叠手机：厂商既想要更大的屏幕，又要手机还能塞进口袋，这个矛盾需求直接推动了可折叠屏幕技术的发展。如果没有“要大屏又要便携”这个约束，大概也没人会花那么多精力去发明折叠屏。

  * [19:02–19:03] **Personal attitude: constraints at work as creative challenges**
    One takeaway from this view of creativity is that every time your boss asks you to “do more with less”—less time, fewer people, smaller budget—you can choose to see it not only as suffering, but as a challenge to your creativity. Instead of simply complaining, you can ask: given these constraints, is there a new way to organise the work, redesign the process, or use technology so that we still achieve the goal?

    从这个角度看，每次老板要求你“用更少的资源做更多的事”——时间更短、人手更少、预算更紧——你可以不只是把它当成一种折磨，而是当成对自己创造力的一次挑战。与其只是抱怨，不如问自己：在这些约束条件下，有没有新的方式来组织工作、重设计流程、或运用技术，让结果依然达标甚至更好？

  * [19:05–19:09] **Where ideas come from: walking, showering, and sleep**
    Many people report that their best ideas come at very ordinary moments: in the toilet, just after waking up, while walking, during a shower, or when doing light exercise. Historical stories echo this. James Watt, who greatly improved the steam engine, described getting a key insight while walking on a Sunday. Dmitri Mendeleev, who developed the periodic table, allegedly struggled for days, then dreamed of the elements falling into place. Modern CEOs and entrepreneurs also say that many of their ideas come during running, showering, or commuting—times when the mind is active but not fully focused on work.

    很多人都说，自己最好的点子往往不是在办公桌前出现的，而是在厕所、刚醒来、散步、洗澡或轻松运动的时候冒出来的。历史故事也有类似描述：大幅改良蒸汽机的瓦特，据说是在周日散步时突然想到关键改进；创立元素周期表的门捷列夫，传说是苦想几天无果后，睡梦中“看到”元素自动排成一个有规律的表。现在很多 CEO 和创业者也会说，他们许多灵感是在跑步、洗澡或通勤时涌现的——那时大脑是活跃的，但并不是死盯着工作任务。

  * [19:09–19:12] **The incubation stage: relaxed but not fully off**
    Psychologists call this the incubation stage. Before incubation, you have already worked hard on a difficult problem and found that your conscious, logical attempts do not fully solve it. During incubation, you are relaxed—but not completely switched off. You are doing something semi-automatic, like walking a familiar route or showering. In this “half-conscious” state, your brain can play with many crazy combinations of ideas without immediately judging them as impossible. Because you are not over-controlling your thinking, two ideas that your logical brain would normally separate can suddenly connect, producing a creative solution.

    心理学把这一段叫做“孵化阶段”。在此之前，你已经很用力地、很理性地去想那个难题，但总觉得解不开。到了孵化阶段，你人是放松的，但并不是完全“关机”——你在做一些半自动化的事情，比如走熟悉的路、洗澡、做简单家务。在这种“半清醒”状态下，大脑会在后台随意地把各种想法组合在一起，而不会像平时那样立刻否决：“这两个怎么可能放在一起？” 正因为你没有过度控制思维，一些平时不会连接的概念突然被连上了，于是出现了有创意的组合。

  * [19:11–19:12] **Why full focus and full rest are less creative**
    When you are fully focused and wide awake, your logical brain acts like a strict gatekeeper: it quickly filters out ideas that seem too strange or unlikely, so you do not give those combinations a chance. On the other hand, when you are completely switched off—deep asleep without any awareness—you may dream, but you usually cannot capture or use those ideas. The incubation state sits in between: relaxed enough not to over-judge, awake enough that useful combinations can later be remembered and tested.

    当你高度专注、非常清醒的时候，理性大脑就像一个严厉的门卫，凡是看起来太怪、太不靠谱的想法，都会被迅速拦在门外，这些组合根本没有试一试的机会。反过来，如果你是完全“断电”的深度睡眠状态，虽然大脑也在活动，但你往往记不住、也用不上那些内容。孵化阶段正好介于两者之间：你足够放松，不会太早下判断，但又保持一定清醒，能在之后回想并验证那些有价值的组合。

  * [19:12–19:15] **Archimedes and verification after insight**
    The famous story of Archimedes shouting “Eureka!” in the bath illustrates both insight and verification. He was given a very hard problem by the king: determine whether a crown was made of pure gold or mixed with silver, without destroying it. Archimedes thought about it for days. Then, while in the bath, he noticed how water level changes with volume and got his key insight. But after the “aha” moment, he still had to verify the idea with measurements. So creativity is not only the sudden idea; it is the whole process: hard work, incubation, insight, and then careful verification.

    阿基米德在浴缸里大喊“尤里卡（我发现了）！”的故事，就是“灵光一现 + 事后验证”的经典例子。国王给他一个非常困难的问题：不破坏王冠的前提下，判断它是不是纯金，还是掺了银。阿基米德为此苦思很多天。后来洗澡时，他注意到水位随物体体积变化的现象，灵感突然爆发，想到了解法。但“啊哈”的瞬间过后，他仍然需要通过测量来验证自己的想法。所以，创造力不仅仅是那一下子“想到”，而是包括：前期苦干、孵化期、灵感闪现，以及后续严谨的验证这一整条链条。

  * [19:16–19:20] **Brain activity in dreams and creative people**
    Neuroscientists have scanned people’s brains during sleep and relaxation. They find that during certain sleep stages—especially when we dream—the brain is very active, jumping rapidly between different memories and concepts, including people and scenes that normally do not appear together. For creative individuals, this kind of wild recombination seems to happen more often or more intensely. This supports the idea that many creative insights are prepared by unconscious processing long before we consciously “receive” them.

    神经科学家对人们在睡眠和放松状态下的大脑活动做过扫描，发现大脑在某些睡眠阶段——尤其是做梦时——非常活跃，会在不同记忆和概念之间快速跳转，把原本不会一起出现的人和场景混在一块儿。对于高创造力的人，这种“乱序重组”的频率或强度往往更高。这些发现支持了一个观点：很多创造性的灵感，其实早就在无意识加工中酝酿好了，只是我们在某个时刻才“收到”它。

  * [19:20–19:23] **Capturing ideas: the shower pen example**
    There is a business anecdote about entrepreneurs noticing that many people get ideas in the shower. One person joked: “Then I should invent a waterproof notepad and pen for the shower so people can write down ideas immediately.” At first glance this sounds reasonable: if ideas appear there, put a capture tool there. But then we must think further: will people really read those notes every time they shower? Is the shower the best place to store all your ideas? The example reminds us that beyond generating ideas, we also need to think carefully about how people will actually use and integrate them into their routines.

    有一个常被讲起的创业段子：既然很多人说自己在洗澡时最容易冒出点子，那是不是应该发明一种“浴室防水记事本和笔”，让大家一有灵感就马上写在浴室墙上？乍一听很合理：哪里产生想法，就把记录工具放在哪里。但再往下想：人们每次洗澡真的会回头一条条看那些笔记吗？浴室是不是保存所有想法的最佳地点？这个例子提醒我们：除了产生创意，还要仔细思考用户之后会怎么用、怎么把它融入自己的生活流程。

  * [19:23–19:24] **Accessible but not constantly in your face**
    A more practical principle is: tools for capturing ideas should be easily accessible, but not constantly in your face. If something keeps reminding you all the time—like a big whiteboard in the shower full of unfinished ideas—it may actually prevent you from relaxing, and that makes incubation harder. So we want capture tools that we can reach quickly when needed, but that do not continuously pull our attention away from relaxing or doing other tasks.

    更实用的原则是：记录想法的工具要“随手可及”，但不要一直“晃在你面前”。如果有个东西一直提醒你——比如浴室里一大块写满未完成想法的白板——你反而很难真正放松，大脑也就不容易进入孵化状态。因此，比较理想的做法是：有一套你能随时拿到的记录工具，但平时不会不断抢走你的注意力。

  * [19:24–19:36] **Procrastination, more incubation time, and capturing ideas**
    There is even a humorous angle: when you procrastinate a little—within limits—you might actually be giving yourself more time to shower, walk, or daydream, which increases the chances for incubation to work. Of course, this is not an excuse for doing nothing until the last minute. The key is: keep engaging with the problem seriously, but also give yourself enough relaxed time for ideas to recombine. At the same time, since our brains forget quickly, you should capture ideas as soon as they appear—on your phone, in a notebook, or in any system you trust. Over time, you build a personal “idea bank” that you can review and develop further.

    这里甚至可以有一点“幽默解读”：适度的拖延（注意是适度），某种意义上也让你多了几次洗澡、散步、发呆的机会，从而给孵化阶段留出时间。当然，这绝对不是“什么都不做，等到最后一刻才开始”的借口。真正有效的做法是：一方面认真啃题，另一方面也给自己足够的放松时间，让大脑在后台重组想法。与此同时，因为大脑忘得很快，一旦有想法冒出来，就要立刻记录下来——不管是写进手机、记在本子上，还是用你习惯的任何系统。久而久之，你就会拥有一个自己的“点子库”，可以反复翻看、慢慢打磨。
## Week 9 Topic 9 Becoming a creative problem solver 10.23
  * [18:16–18:17] **Wanting the “creative person” label**
    Think about being the kind of person who can always come up with creative solutions. Among your colleagues and friends, people might say, “Oh, he’s very creative; he always has good ideas.” Ask yourself if this is the label you want others to give you.

    想一想，你是不是想成为那种“总是能想出有创意解决方案的人”。在同事、朋友当中，别人会说：“哎，他很有创意，每次都有新点子。”先问问自己，这是不是你想要别人贴在你身上的标签。

  * [18:17–18:18] **Problem solving as a multi-stage process**
    But the real question is: how do we become such a person? From earlier weeks, we already know that solving problems should be managed as a process with different stages. In the problem-definition stage, the goal is to converge and craft a clear, SMART problem statement. In the solution-generation stage, the goal flips: you want to diverge and maximise possibilities, generating as many ideas as you can. After that comes a selection stage, where you choose one or two solutions that best meet your requirements and constraints. At each stage, you focus single-mindedly on a different outcome.

    那关键问题是：我们要怎样才变成这样的人？在前几周我们已经讲过，解决问题要当成一个“过程”来管理，它是分阶段的。在“问题定义”阶段，目标是收敛，写出一个清楚、符合 SMART 原则的问题陈述。在“方案产生”阶段，目标刚好相反，要发散，尽可能多地提出各种方案。接下来是“方案选择”阶段，从中挑出一两个最符合要求和约束的选项。在每一个阶段，你都要单点聚焦在当下这个阶段该产出的结果上。

  * [18:18] **Methods we learned all share stages**
    All the methodologies we have learned so far—Design Thinking, Six Sigma DMAIC, and others—follow this same logic. They all break problem solving into distinct stages. So we already understand the framework.

    到目前为止我们学过的所有方法——比如设计思维、六西格玛的 DMAIC 等——其实都是同样的逻辑，都是把解决问题拆成几个清楚的阶段。所以这个“框架”本身我们是懂的。

  * [18:18] **Knowing the stages ≠ being consistently creative**
    However, just knowing this staged process does not mean we can routinely produce creative solutions. Otherwise, we would not see “one-hit wonders” in music—singers who had one famous song and then disappeared. We want to be more like Michael Jackson or other artists who can repeatedly produce hit songs, not just be creative once in a lifetime.

    但是，仅仅知道有这些阶段，并不等于你就能“稳定地”想出有创意的方案。就像在音乐界会有“一首歌红一辈子”的歌手，只红过一次就没了。我们希望自己更像 Michael Jackson 这种，能一再写出“爆款歌”的人，而不是只创意一次就结束。

  * [18:18] **Have you measured your creativity?**
    So the question becomes: how do we become consistently creative? Let me ask you: do you think you are creative? Have you ever actually measured your creativity? Last week I asked you to try a simple creativity test. Did you try it?

    所以问题就变成：我们怎样才能“持续地”有创意？我先反问你们：你觉得自己有创意吗？你有没有真正量过自己的创造力？上周我让大家做过一个简单的创造力测验，你们有认真试吗？

  * [18:24–18:25] **Divergent-thinking tests only measure brainstorming**
    That kind of test mainly measures how good you are at brainstorming different ideas, or how likely you are to think of many uses for something. That is all it measures. It does not mean you can solve problems well overall.

    那种测验主要测的是：你在“脑力激荡”时能不能想出很多不同的点子，也就是你的发散思维能力。它只测这一点，并不代表你整体上就会“很会解决问题”。

  * [18:25–18:26] **Creativity depends on multiple stages, weakest link limits you**
    We know that solving problems usually involves four or five stages. Divergent thinking is only one of those stages. You might be excellent at generating ideas, but if you are weak at earlier stages like problem definition, or later stages like verification and implementation, you still cannot solve problems creatively. In other words, your overall creative problem-solving ability is constrained by your weakest stage among the four or five stages.

    我们知道，解决一个问题通常要经过四五个阶段，发散思维只是其中一个阶段。你在“想点子”这块可能很强，但如果你在前面的“问题定义”阶段不行，或者在后面的“验证、落地”阶段不行，你整体上还是做不到真正“有创意地解决问题”。换句话说，你的创意解题能力，会被这四五个阶段中最弱的那一环拉低。

  * [18:27–18:28] **Why creative problem-solving is hard**
    That is why creative problem solving is difficult. In a sense, you need to be reasonably good in several different areas at once. On top of that, the mental modes required at different stages can even feel contradictory to each other—what helps in one stage may not help, or may even hinder, another stage.

    这就是为什么“有创意地解决问题”这么难。某种程度上，你得同时在好几个不同的方面都还不错。而且，不同阶段需要的心态和思维模式，有时彼此是有点“打架”的——在某一阶段很有用的特质，放到另一阶段可能完全帮不上忙，甚至会影响发挥。

  * [18:28–18:29] **Our brain prefers the familiar path**
    Another reason it is hard is that our brain does not naturally like to “think differently”. When we face a problem, we tend to think in the usual way instead of exploring an unusual perspective. We have already seen from previous lectures and research that the brain has a strong tendency to repeat familiar patterns rather than search for new ones.

    另外一个难点在于，大脑本身并不“自然地”喜欢与众不同的思考。遇到问题时，我们本能上会走熟悉的套路，而不是主动去换一个角度看。同样的结论，在之前几次课讲过的研究里也出现过：大脑很倾向于重复熟悉的模式，而不是主动去探索新的模式。

  * [18:29–18:31] **Brain energy, sugar, and being “wired”**
    Think about sweets. Sugary food gives us quick energy, and our brain likes that feeling. Over a long time, our brain has become “wired” so that, whenever there is food in front of us—especially sweet food—we tend to overeat. This is partly because the brain is always trying to save effort and get energy the easiest way.

    想一想甜食。含糖的东西可以很快给我们提供能量，大脑很喜欢这种感觉。长期下来，大脑就被“写死”成一种模式：只要面前有东西吃，特别是甜的，我们就容易吃多。这背后有一个原因，就是大脑总是在想办法“省力”：用最轻松的方式拿到能量。

  * [18:31–18:32] **Neurons as the basis of thought**
    So what is the brain actually made of? It is primarily made up of neurons, and here on the slide you can see pictures of neurons. The current view is that the brain processes information through large networks of these neurons. When I say a word to you, certain neurons in your brain fire, and this activity spreads through the network.

    那么，大脑本质上是由什么组成的？主要就是神经元，这里投影片上给了神经元的图片。现在的主流看法是：大脑就是通过大量神经元网络来处理信息的。当我跟你说一个词，你脑中某些神经元会被激活，然后这种活动会在整个网络中传播开来。

  * [18:31–18:32] **How neural networks create patterns**
    Information processing works by different neurons getting excited and then stimulating other neurons. As these signals travel through a huge network, certain paths become stronger because they are used repeatedly. This is how habits and familiar patterns of thought are formed in the brain.

    信息处理的过程，就是一些神经元先被激活，然后再去激活其他神经元。信号在庞大的网络里一遍一遍走，常走的那几条“路径”就会变得越来越强，这就是大脑里“习惯”和“熟悉思路”形成的机制。

  * [18:35–18:36] **Analogy: calculators and when to use tools**
    This is a bit like deciding at what stage in school we allow students to use calculators. For mathematics, we more or less know the rule: before a certain level, you must still learn to calculate manually; after that, a calculator is allowed to speed things up. The tool automates a process you already understand.

    这有点像我们在学校里决定：从哪个年级开始可以用计算器。对数学来说，大致的原则很清楚：在某个阶段之前，一定要先学会手算；之后才可以用计算器来加快速度。也就是说，工具只是把一个你本来就懂的过程自动化了。

  * [18:35–18:37] **Why GenAI is trickier than a calculator**
    GenAI is trickier than a calculator. With a calculator, you usually already understand the formulas and logic; the machine just does the arithmetic for you. With GenAI, we are most tempted to use it precisely in subjects we do not really know well. In those areas, our internal “neural network” is not well connected. That makes it hard for us to judge which parts of the AI output are correct and which are not.

    生成式人工智能要复杂得多。用计算器的时候，我们一般已经懂了公式和逻辑，机器只是帮你把数字算出来而已。但用 GenAI 的时候，我们往往最想在自己“不太懂”的领域依赖它，而在这些领域，我们自己脑中的“神经网络”其实并没有建立好。这时就很难判断：AI 给的哪些内容是对的，哪些其实是错的。

  * [18:36–18:37] **Risk: losing our own understanding**
    Because GenAI is so powerful and can cover so many topics, there is a danger that we slowly stop building our own understanding. At first, you may still be in areas you are familiar with, so you can check the answers. But as you keep using AI, you may drift into areas you do not understand, while still feeling confident. That is dangerous because you can no longer tell where the model is reliable and where it is hallucinating.

    正因为 GenAI 太强大、覆盖面太广，风险就在于：我们可能慢慢失去自己动脑的过程。一开始你还停留在自己熟悉的领域，可以帮它检查，但用久了，你可能不知不觉滑进自己根本不懂的领域，却依然很“自信”。危险就在这里——你已经分不清模型在哪些地方靠谱，在哪些地方是在“乱编”。

  * [18:37–18:38] **Brain plasticity: environment matters**
    Next, the lecture shows two brain diagrams from animal studies. One brain comes from an animal kept alone in a bare cage without stimulation; the other comes from an animal in a rich, stimulating environment with toys and other animals. The takeaway is that the brain is like a muscle: the more it is challenged and stimulated, the more connections it builds.

    接下来，课上给大家看了两张动物大脑的对比图。一只是关在空笼子里、几乎没有刺激的动物；另一只是生活在环境丰富、有玩具、有同伴的动物。结论很清楚：大脑就像肌肉一样，被不断挑战、不断刺激，它建立的连接就会越多、越强。

  * [18:38–18:39] **Learning most when we struggle and get things wrong**
    Research shows that our brain grows the most not when we get answers right, but when we struggle, make mistakes, and then seriously review why we were wrong. When you face adversity or frustration and still reflect on it, that is when your neurons are most actively forming new connections. From a learning perspective, those uncomfortable moments are actually the most valuable.

    研究发现，大脑“成长”最多的时刻，不是在你轻松答对题目的时候，而是在你卡住、做错、然后认真回头检查自己哪里错了的时候。当你遇到困难、挫折，还愿意去反思，这时你的神经元其实在最积极地建立新连接。站在学习的角度看，那些让你不舒服的时刻，反而是最有价值的。

  * [18:39–18:40] **Why mistakes help creativity**
    So when you get something wrong, and you analyse the feedback and try again, you are stimulating your neurons to move closer and connect better. Over time, this richer network supports stronger, more flexible thinking—which is exactly what we need for creativity.

    因此，当你做错题、收到反馈、认真分析并重新尝试的时候，其实是在推动神经元彼此靠近、连得更好。时间久了，这种更丰富的网络就能支撑更强、更灵活的思考能力——而这正是创造力所需要的基础。

  * [18:40–18:51] **Incubation, association, and “brain dark matter” (summary of video)**
    The video the lecturer showed explains that during “REST” or default-mode states—when you are relaxed, not focused on external tasks—the association cortices in your brain are very active. These areas link different memories and experiences together. They consume a lot of the brain’s energy and are sometimes called the brain’s “dark matter”. Creative people tend to have richer and more active association networks, so they can form connections that others do not see.

    课上放的视频提到，当我们处在所谓的“默认模式”（REST）——也就是人放松下来、不专注做外部任务的时候——大脑里的联想皮层其实非常活跃。这些区域负责把不同的记忆和经验连在一起，占用了大脑很大一部分能量，有人把它形容为大脑的“暗物质”。有创意的人往往在这些区域有更丰富、更活跃的网络，所以他们更容易看到别人看不到的联系。

  * [19:02–19:03] **Creativity needs both ideas and incubation**
    Putting this together, we know that to have creative ideas, our brain needs two things: first, raw materials—ideas and memories stored in the brain; second, incubation time—periods of rest or low-pressure activity where these materials can quietly connect. If you only work very hard for two days on “being creative” and then stop, you will not become a creative problem solver.

    综合起来看，要有创意点子，大脑至少需要两样东西：第一，是“原材料”，也就是存进去的各种记忆和知识；第二，是“孵化时间”，也就是那些放松、低压力的时刻，让这些材料在后台慢慢自己连在一起。如果你只是拼命两天想“我要变有创意”，然后就放弃，是不可能真正变成有创意的解题者的。

  * [19:03] **Creativity as a long-term habit, like fitness**
    Creativity is like physical fitness. If you want to be healthy and fit, you cannot just exercise intensively for two days and then never exercise again. You need consistent habits over a long period. Similarly, if you want to be a creative problem solver, you must build certain long-term habits, not rely on short bursts of motivation.

    创造力就像体能。如果你想身体健康、体能好，不可能靠两天猛练、之后完全不动来实现，你需要长期稳定的习惯。同样地，如果你想成为一个有创意的解题者，必须培养一些长期习惯，而不是靠一两次“突然很有冲劲”就指望有质变。

  * [19:03–19:04] **Habits that support creativity**
    Useful habits include: regularly reading different kinds of books, travelling and exposing yourself to different cultures, and giving yourself time for incubation—walks, showers, quiet moments. These habits have to be done consistently over many years for the effect to accumulate.

    对创造力有帮助的习惯包括：经常读不同类型的书、多出去旅行、接触不同的文化，还要给自己一些孵化的时间——比如散步、洗澡、安静发呆的时刻。关键是，这些事情要很多年坚持下来，效果才会慢慢累积。

  * [19:03–19:04] **Why habits beat short-term determination**
    Many studies show that in the long run, habits are more powerful than short bursts of determination. The people who eventually succeed are usually not the ones who were “very motivated for a few days”, but the ones who quietly repeat small, constructive behaviours until they become automatic.

    很多研究都表明，从长期来看，“习惯”比“短期的决心”更有力量。最后真正做出成绩的，往往不是那种“几天超级有动力”的人，而是那些默默地把一些小的、有益的行为重复到变成自动化的人。

  * [19:04–19:05] **Example: reading habit linked to flying**
    The lecturer gives a personal example: nowadays, every time he takes a flight, he will deliberately go to the airport bookshop, buy a book, and read it on the plane. Over time this has become a habit: when he has a six-hour flight, he does not even think about turning on the in-flight entertainment screen; his default is to read.

    老师举了自己的例子：现在他每次坐飞机，都会刻意去机场书店买一本书，在飞机上看。时间一长，这就变成了习惯：一旦有六个小时的航程，他根本不会想到要打开机上的荧幕，而是自然地就会拿书出来读。

  * [19:05–19:06] **Atomic Habits idea: reduce friction and make it tiny**
    There are also books that explain how to cultivate habits by reducing friction and making the action very small. For example, many people find it hard to floss their teeth. One suggestion is: prepare the floss the night before and commit to flossing just one tooth. Once you start, doing more is easy, but the key is to make the first step so small that you cannot refuse.

    还有一些书（比如习惯养成类的）会教你用“降低阻力、从极小开始”的方法来建立习惯。比如很多人觉得使用牙线很麻烦，那么做法是：前一天晚上先把牙线准备好，并且只要求自己“先用牙线清理一颗牙”就行。一旦开始，继续做就很容易了，关键是把开头那一步缩小到几乎无法拒绝。

  * [19:05–19:06] **Designing the environment to support habits**
    Similarly, if you want to go running in the morning, you can prepare your running shoes and clothes the night before and place them where you will see them immediately after waking up. If you want to eat healthily, you can make sure your fridge contains only fruits and vegetables, not junk food. By designing your environment this way, you remove small obstacles, and the habit gradually becomes automatic.

    同样地，如果你想早上去跑步，可以在前一晚就把跑鞋、运动服准备好，放在一醒来就能看到的地方。如果你想吃得更健康，可以让冰箱里只放水果和蔬菜，不放垃圾食品。通过这样设计环境，你把小障碍一点点拿掉，这样习惯就比较容易慢慢变成“自动行为”。

  * [19:06–19:07] **Using rituals and physical spaces to build habits**
    Another technique is to build a habit around a specific place and time. For example, you can designate a corner in your house as your “Saturday morning reading spot”. Every Saturday morning, make yourself a good coffee, sit in that same chair, and keep a book you enjoy right next to it. After some time, your brain forms an association: “Saturday morning = reading”, and it becomes automatic.

    另一种方法是把习惯“固定在某个地点和时间上”。例如，你可以在家里选一个角落当作“星期六早上读书角”。每个星期六早上泡一杯咖啡，坐在同一张椅子上，旁边放着你喜欢的书。时间久了，大脑自然会把“星期六早上＝读书”连结起来，让这个行为变得自动化。

  * [19:06–19:07] **Travel and exposure strongly boost creativity**
    A large amount of research confirms that living abroad, traveling, meeting different people, and being exposed to diverse cultures have a direct effect on creativity. These experiences enrich the “raw materials” in your brain by giving you new memories, new mental models, and new perspectives.

    很多研究都证明：留学、旅行、认识不同的人、接触不同文化，会直接提升创造力。这些体验会把新的“原材料”放进你的大脑，让你有更多记忆、更多思维模式、更多视角可以组合。

  * [19:07] **Accumulating diverse mental Lego bricks**
    The lecturer explains this using a metaphor. As he studied abroad, traveled, and worked in different companies, his brain accumulated “Lego pieces” of many shapes—metal bricks, plastic bricks, triangular pieces, circular pieces, and so on. These represent different ideas, frameworks, and observations gathered from life.

    老师用一个比喻来说明：随着他在国外读书、旅行、换工作，他的大脑里累积了各种形状的“乐高积木”——金属的、塑料的、三角形的、圆形的等等。这些其实就是生活里累积来的各种想法、框架、观察。

  * [19:07–19:08] **Eureka moments come from rich combinations**
    Later, when he faced a very difficult problem—how to design a maritime innovation ecosystem—these Lego pieces suddenly connected in surprising ways during incubation moments like taking a shower. Out of thousands of possible combinations, one combination “clicked”, creating a Eureka moment.

    后来他遇到一个特别难的问题——如何设计一个海事创新生态系统——在洗澡等孵化时刻，这些积木突然以意想不到的方式连在一起。在成千上万种组合里，有一种突然“对上了”，这就是灵光一现的“啊哈时刻”。

  * [19:08] **Creativity fails without stored raw materials**
    The important reminder is this: if you do not read, do not observe, do not experience new things, your brain has no raw materials. Then even if you want to incubate ideas, there is nothing for your mind to connect. It is like trying to build with Lego when you have no bricks.

    重点提醒是：如果你不读、不看、不体验新事物，你的大脑里就没有原材料。这样即使你有孵化时间，也没东西可以组合。就像你想用乐高造东西，但桌上根本没有积木一样。

  * [19:08–19:09] **Your brain is a cognitive miser—give it energy**
    Our brain is a “cognitive miser”—it tries to save effort whenever possible. When you lack energy or glucose, you default to familiar thinking patterns. In a joking tone, the lecturer says: “If you don’t have enough energy, just eat more sweets,” meaning: creativity needs mental energy.

    大脑本质上是“认知吝啬鬼”，能省力就省力。能量不足时，它只会走熟路。老师半开玩笑地说：“没精力就吃点糖”，意思是说：创造力需要大脑有足够能量去探索新的思考路径。

  * [19:09] **Three long-term requirements: habits, exposure, incubation**
    So to become more creative in the long term, you need:

    1. Habits that continuously bring new information into your brain (reading, traveling, meeting people)
    2. Habits of copying, studying, and comparing different ideas
    3. Regular incubation time where ideas can collide and recombine

    因此，要长期提升创造力，你需要三样东西：
    1）能持续把新资讯放进大脑的习惯（读书、旅行、接触人）
    2）比较、模仿、学习不同想法的习惯
    3）固定的孵化时间，让想法在后台自己碰撞、重组

  * [19:09–19:10] **Short term: use techniques; long term: build habits**
    In the short term, you can use techniques taught in this course. But over the long term, habits and incubation matter far more. The lecturer emphasises that this difference—techniques vs. habits—is the real key.

    短期内，你可以用这堂课教的各种技巧；但长期来看，“习惯”和“孵化”才是决定性因素。老师特别强调：技巧与习惯的区别，就是关键所在。

  * [19:10] **Transition to AI: the next big question**
    After explaining the human side of creativity, the lecture now moves to the final big topic: how will AI—especially GenAI—change the way we solve problems creatively? The lecturer notes that this part is still evolving in research.

    在讲完人的创造力机制之后，课程进入最后一个大主题：AI（特别是生成式 AI）会怎样改变我们解决问题的方式？老师也说明，这部分在研究界仍在发展中。

  * [19:10] **Four guiding questions of the course**
    The course is structured around four major questions. The class has already covered the first three, and now reaches the fourth: How will GenAI change creative problem solving?

    这门课其实围绕四个大问题展开。前三个问题已经讲完，现在进入第四个：“生成式 AI 会怎样改变创意解题？”

  * [19:10–19:11] **Define what GenAI is before analysing its role**
    Before answering how AI changes problem solving, we must define what GenAI actually is. Only then can we analyse how GenAI will affect each stage of the creative problem-solving process.

    在讨论 AI 会如何改变解题之前，我们必须先定义“生成式 AI”到底是什么。只有在概念清楚之后，才能分析它对每一个解题阶段的影响。

  * [19:11] **Using process thinking to analyse AI’s role**
    One approach is to view creative problem solving as a four-stage process, then analyse one by one how GenAI affects each stage:
    • Problem definition
    • Solution generation
    • Solution selection
    • Implementation

    一种方法是把“创意解题”当成四个阶段的流程，然后逐一分析生成式 AI 会怎么影响每一阶段：
    • 问题定义
    • 方案产生
    • 方案选择
    • 方案落实

  * [19:11] **Two possible ways to treat AI: student vs. expert**
    Another approach is to treat AI as if it were:
    • a teammate with limited knowledge (like a student), or
    • an all-knowing expert.
    Depending on which framing you choose, the way you collaborate with AI in the problem-solving process becomes different.

    另一种方法是把 AI 当成：
    • 一个知识有限的队友（像学生），或
    • 一个什么都懂的专家。
    你选择哪种视角，会影响你与 AI 在解题过程中的合作方式。

  * [19:11–19:12] **LLMs work through next-token prediction**
    The lecturer reminds the class of a basic concept: LLMs fundamentally work by next-token prediction. They predict what comes next based on patterns in their training data. This is similar to how neural connections in the brain strengthen from repeated association.

    老师提醒大家一个基本概念：大型语言模型本质上是“下一个 token 预测器”。它根据训练资料中反复出现的模式来预测下一个最可能的字。某种程度上，这和大脑中“反复连在一起的神经连接会变强”是类似的机制。

  * [19:12] **For common problems, AI predicts typical patterns**
    Because LLMs rely on past patterns, what has frequently happened in the past is what the model predicts in the future. That means they are especially good at common, well-documented problems.

    因为模型靠“过去最常出现的模式”来预测未来，所以它特别擅长处理那些常见、有大量资料的典型问题。

  * [19:12–19:13] **Connecting this to problem-solving stages**
    Now the question becomes: for each stage of creative problem solving, can AI help produce the intended outcome?
    • Can AI help produce a smart problem statement?
    • Can AI help generate many possible solutions?
    • Does AI help or hinder selection?
    • Does AI help with implementation?

    接下来关键的问题是：在创意解题的每一个阶段，AI 能不能帮我们得到想要的产出？
    • AI 能帮我们写出更好的问题陈述吗？
    • AI 能帮我们发散出更多可能方案吗？
    • AI 会帮忙还是会妨碍选择？
    • AI 会怎样影响方案的落实？

  * [19:13–19:14] **Issue trees vs. AI-generated lists**
    Traditionally, to understand a problem, students build an issue tree using structured logic. But recently the lecturer realised something surprising: with AI, maybe we do not even need a perfectly structured issue tree anymore. If the model can give a comprehensive list of possible causes, perhaps that is enough for certain tasks.

    过去，我们会用结构化逻辑来画 issue tree（问题树）以理解问题。但老师最近发现一件有趣的事：有了 AI，也许我们甚至不需要一个“超级完美的 issue tree”。如果模型能给出一个相对完整的“可能原因列表”，有时这就足够用了。

  * [19:14] **AI can provide lists, but not relationships**
    However, AI can list possible causes, but it usually cannot clearly explain the logical relationships between them—unless the model has been trained heavily on domain-specific material.

    但要注意：AI 很擅长列出“可能原因列表”，却往往无法清楚解释这些原因之间的逻辑关系——除非模型大量训练过某个领域的专门知识。

  * [19:14–19:15] **Analogy: AI vs. manual calculation**
    The lecturer compares this to calculators again:
    • Manual calculation = you understand every step and relationship.
    • Calculator = you get the final answer without seeing the reasoning.
    Using AI for issue lists is similar: you get the answers, but not the reasoning structure.

    老师再次用计算器来比喻：
    • 手算＝你清楚看到每个步骤与逻辑关系
    • 计算器＝只给结果，不给过程
    用 AI 生成“原因列表”也是类似：你能得到结果，但背后的结构不一定清楚。

  * [19:15] **Creativity and hallucination: a key insight**
    A surprising insight emerges: when humans think creatively, especially during incubation, our brains “hallucinate”. Dreams, crazy associations, strange combinations—that is all hallucination. Many ideas are nonsense, but among thousands of hallucinations, one may become a breakthrough.

    一个让人惊讶的洞见是：人在创意思考时，尤其在孵化阶段，其实也在“幻觉”。做梦、乱想、奇怪的联想——这些都是一种幻觉。大多数都是胡思乱想，但在一大堆不靠谱的组合里，往往会有那一个成为突破点。

  * [19:15–19:16] **Therefore: can we force AI to hallucinate?**
    This leads to a radical question: can we deliberately make AI hallucinate—not to produce correct answers, but to produce crazy, unexpected, creative possibilities? Most hallucinations will be wrong, but one might be extraordinarily creative.

    因此就引出了一个大胆的问题：我们能不能“刻意让 AI 幻觉”？不是为了正确答案，而是为了那些疯狂、意料之外、有创意的组合。大部分结果都会是错的，但有可能其中某一个超乎想像、价值极高。

  * [19:16] **Prompt engineering is basically problem definition**
    The lecturer then shows common prompt-engineering frameworks online—tasks, context, constraints, examples, preferences, etc. He points out that these are essentially **good problem definition** skills. Prompt engineering is just structured problem solving under a different name.

    老师接着展示网路上常见的 prompt 工程框架——任务、背景、限制、偏好、示例等等。他指出：这些本质上就是“如何写好问题定义”。Prompt 工程只不过是换了个名字的结构化解题。

  * [19:17–19:18] **Fancy acronyms, same thinking**
    Online frameworks may use fancy acronyms, but all boil down to:
    • explain the context
    • define the role
    • state the goal
    • set boundaries
    This is exactly what students already practice in their MT5021 group projects.

    网路上的框架再怎么花俏，本质都是：
    • 说明情境
    • 定义扮演者
    • 写出目标
    • 设定约束
    这些其实就是你们 MT5021 小组作业里已经在做的事情。

  * [19:18–19:19] **Do we still need issue trees?**
    This brings back the earlier question: with AI able to list many possible causes of a problem, do we still need a manually built issue tree? Issue trees are hard to build, but they ensure logical completeness. AI lists may be incomplete but faster.

    这就回到刚才的问题：既然 AI 能列出很多可能原因，我们还需要 painstaking 地画 issue tree 吗？Issue tree 很难画，但保证逻辑完备；AI 列表也许不完美，但快得多。

  * [19:19–19:20] **How students traditionally derive causes**
    Traditionally, students start from the main problem and logically derive a tree of smaller causes. Then they compare this list to the real-world context to see which causes matter most.

    传统做法是：从主要问题往下推，逻辑化地画出一棵“原因树”。然后再把这些原因一一拿去现实场景里检查，看哪一些真的成立、哪一些不相关。

  * [19:20–19:21] **AI can now produce the same list instantly**
    But now, a student can simply ask AI:
    “What are the possible causes of low profit in a theme park?”
    And AI will instantly give a list: demand issues, pricing issues, F&B, merchandise, lodging, operations, etc.
    This is similar to what a well-constructed issue tree would include.

    但现在学生可以直接问 AI：
    “主题乐园利润低的可能原因有哪些？”
    AI 就会瞬间给出一个列表：需求问题、票价策略、餐饮、商品、住宿、营运等等。
    这些内容和一棵画得很完整的 issue tree 基本一致。

  * [19:21–19:22] **AI results are often comprehensive for common problems**
    For common business problems, AI’s list is usually comprehensive enough. But it still cannot show the deeper structural relationships unless it has been trained on very specific materials.

    对于常见的商业问题，AI 生成的列表通常已经“够全面”了。但它仍然难以解释更深层的结构关系，除非模型在该领域被大量训练过。

  * [19:22–19:23] **Segmentation: AI can classify sub-issues**
    After listing causes, some models will even ask: “Do you want me to segment them?” If you say yes, AI will group the causes into categories—just like we do manually:
    • Admission (tickets)
    • F&B
    • Merchandise
    • Operations
    • Lodging
    This is essentially the same structure students would manually derive.

    在列出原因之后，有些模型甚至会问你：“需要我分类吗？”
    如果你按“要”，AI 会把原因分成各类别——就像你们自己手动分类那样：
    • 入园票价
    • 餐饮
    • 商品销售
    • 营运流程
    • 住宿
    这其实和学生自己推出来的结构差不多。

  * [19:23] **AI can approximate what humans derive logically**
    If the problem is common enough, the output that AI generates will often be very similar to what a human would produce using a logical issue tree. The difference is that when you build it manually, you understand the relationships clearly; when AI generates it, you only see the final categories.

    如果问题本身够常见，AI 给出的内容往往会和人类用逻辑推出来的 issue tree 很接近。差别在于：你手动画的时候，会非常清楚每个因果关系；AI 给的只是分类结果，你看不到“逻辑的推导过程”。

  * [19:23] **Manual reasoning vs. automated output**
    This is like the analogy earlier:
    • manual reasoning = showing every step of long division
    • AI output = giving the final quotient directly
    Both can be useful, but they serve different purposes.

    这就像前面说的比喻：
    • 手动推理＝像手算长除法，每一步都清楚
    • AI 输出＝像计算器，直接告诉你答案
    两者都能用，但用途不一样。
